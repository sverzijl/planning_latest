## 5. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Design System Adoption Delays
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (blocks Phase 1 quick wins)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start WP1.1 immediately (Day 1)
  - Incremental CSS delivery: basic colors/typography (Day 3), advanced components (Day 5)
  - Allow WP1.2-1.4 to start with basic design system if WP1.1 runs long
- **Fallback:** Use Streamlit default styling, apply design system in later polish pass

### Risk 2: Scenario Management Complexity
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (affects Phase 2 timeline)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simple in-memory storage (session state only)
  - File export/import as secondary feature (can defer if needed)
  - Use Python pickling for full state serialization (simpler than custom JSON)
- **Fallback:** Defer file export to Phase 4, keep session-based scenarios only

### Risk 3: Test Coverage Regression
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High (breaks CI/CD, blocks deployment)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run test suite after every work package completion
  - pytest-watch for continuous testing during development
  - Code reviewer validates test coverage at each checkpoint
  - Minimum 90% coverage maintained
- **Fallback:** Dedicated testing sprint at end of each phase if coverage drops

### Risk 4: Agent Context Switching Overhead
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Low-Medium (reduces efficiency)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Batch work for same agent (all streamlit-ui-designer work on similar pages together)
  - Clear handoff documentation between agents
  - Dedicated "ownership" of files (ui/ → streamlit-ui-designer, src/exporters/ → production-planner)
- **Fallback:** Serialize work packages if parallel execution proves inefficient

### Risk 5: User Workflow Disruption During Navigation Redesign
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High (confuses existing users)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Keep old navigation until new navigation is fully tested (feature flag)
  - Gradual rollout: new sidebar first, page consolidation second
  - "Switch to Classic Navigation" toggle during transition period
- **Fallback:** Defer page consolidation if sidebar redesign is sufficient

### Risk 6: Performance Degradation from New Features
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (slows user workflows)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Performance testing after WP2.2 (scenario management) and WP3.1 (progressive disclosure)
  - Aggressive caching (@st.cache_data for expensive operations)
  - Lazy loading for large datasets (pagination, virtualization)
  - Benchmark: home page load <2s, planning execution <30s
- **Fallback:** python-pro sprint to optimize bottlenecks (1-2 days)

### Risk 7: Excel/PDF Export Format Misalignment with User Needs
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (requires rework)
- **Mitigation:**
  - production-planner designs formats FIRST, gets stakeholder approval before implementation
  - Provide 2-3 format options for key exports (simple vs detailed)
  - Early prototype review (after WP1.3 day 2)
- **Fallback:** Iterative refinement in Phase 3, treat initial exports as "draft" versions

## 11. Resource Requirements

### Agent Time Allocation

| Agent | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Total Days |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| streamlit-ui-designer | 17 days | 18 days | 15 days | 50 days |
| production-planner | 9 days | 12 days | 11 days | 32 days |
| python-pro | 5 days | 7 days | 6 days | 18 days |
| code-reviewer | 1 day | 1 day | 1 day | 3 days |
| **Total** | **32 days** | **38 days** | **33 days** | **103 days** |

**Note:** Days overlap due to parallel execution; actual wall-clock time is 50 days (10 weeks)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Development Environment:** Python 3.11+, Streamlit 1.28+
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Pytest, pytest-cov, CI/CD pipeline
- **Storage:** Session state (in-memory), scenario export (local filesystem)
- **External Libraries:**
  - PDF generation: reportlab or fpdf2
  - Excel I/O: openpyxl (already in requirements.txt)
  - Charts: plotly (already in requirements.txt)

### Stakeholder Availability
- **Production Planner (Domain Expert):** 5 hours/week for validation, format review
- **End Users (UAT):** 2 hours/week for testing (Phases 2-3)
- **Management (Go/No-Go):** 1 hour per phase checkpoint

---

## 12. Contingency Planning

### Scenario: Phase 1 Runs Long (Design System Delays)
- **Trigger:** WP1.1 not complete by Day 5
- **Action:**
  - Deliver minimal design system (colors, typography only) by Day 3
  - Allow WP1.2-1.4 to proceed with basic styling
  - Complete advanced components (status indicators, cards) in parallel with WP1.2
- **Impact:** +2-3 days to Phase 1, no impact on later phases

### Scenario: Scenario Management Too Complex (WP2.2)
- **Trigger:** Implementation blocked or exceeds 7-day estimate by 50%
- **Action:**
  - Descope to session-state-only scenarios (no file export/import)
  - Limit to 5 scenarios max (memory constraints)
  - Move file export/import to Phase 4 backlog
- **Impact:** Reduced functionality, but core scenario compare feature intact

### Scenario: Test Coverage Drops Below 90%
- **Trigger:** Test coverage report shows <90% after any work package
- **Action:**
  - Halt new development for that agent
  - Dedicated testing sprint (1-2 days)
  - python-pro writes missing tests
  - Resume development only after coverage restored
- **Impact:** +1-2 days to affected phase

### Scenario: User Acceptance Failure at Checkpoint
- **Trigger:** Stakeholders reject deliverable at Phase 1/2/3 checkpoint
- **Action:**
  - Prioritize feedback into P0 (must-fix) and P1 (should-fix)
  - Allocate 2-3 days for rework
  - Re-review before proceeding to next phase
  - Adjust future work packages based on feedback patterns
- **Impact:** +2-3 days per checkpoint failure

### Scenario: Key Agent Unavailable (Illness, Vacation)
- **Trigger:** Agent unable to work for 3+ consecutive days
- **Action:**
  - **streamlit-ui-designer unavailable:** python-pro covers UI work (slower, accept delay)
  - **production-planner unavailable:** Defer domain validation, proceed with best-effort assumptions
  - **python-pro unavailable:** streamlit-ui-designer handles simpler backend work (exports, alerts)
- **Impact:** +30% time to affected work packages (e.g., 5-day WP becomes 7 days)

## 14. Conclusion

This orchestration plan delivers a comprehensive UI transformation in 10 weeks through coordinated multi-agent execution. By prioritizing foundation work (design system, exports), enabling parallel execution where possible, and maintaining rigorous quality gates, the plan achieves:

✅ **70%+ reduction in planning cycle time** (53min → <15min)
✅ **30% increase in test coverage** (266 → 344 tests)
✅ **Professional-grade UX** (B- → A grade)
✅ **Production-ready features** (exports, scenarios, alerts, onboarding)
✅ **Minimal risk** (incremental delivery, comprehensive testing, clear fallbacks)

The phased approach ensures continuous user value delivery while managing complexity through clear agent responsibilities, defined handoffs, and quality checkpoints.

**Next Steps:**
1. Assign agents to Phase 1 work packages
2. Schedule kickoff meeting (all agents)
3. Set up project tracking (work package board, daily standups)
4. Begin WP1.1 (Design System) on Day 1
