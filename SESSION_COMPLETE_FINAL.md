Weekdays:
  - First 12h: FREE (sunk cost)
  - Hours 12-14: $660/h (overtime)

Weekends:
  - All hours: $1,320/h

Result: Weekdays strongly preferred
```

## üêõ Major Bugs Fixed (This Session)

### **1. Phantom Inventory** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
```
Symptom: 345k demand satisfied with 78k supply
Cause: Unconstrained thaw variables
Impact: 28k phantom units
Fix: Only create thaw where frozen inventory exists
Result: Material balance restored
```

### **2. Truck Capacity Over-Counting** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
```
Symptom: Production 48k (should be 300k)
Cause: Truck constraint summed across all dates
Impact: 6√ó production loss
Fix: Filter by departure date + day-of-week
Result: Full production restored
```

### **3. Labor Cost Bug**
```
Symptom: Weekend production when weekday capacity available
Cause: All labor treated as $0/h
Impact: No weekday preference
Fix: Piecewise cost (weekdays free, weekends expensive)
Result: Weekdays preferred
```

### **4. Daily Snapshot Format**
```
Symptom: Only 6122 showing, inventory wrong
Cause: Expected cohort format, got aggregate
Impact: Missing 10 locations
Fix: Detect aggregate model, read inventory directly
Result: All 11 locations visible
```

### **5. Multiple UI Compatibility Issues**
```
- 3-tuple production keys (not 2-tuple)
- UnifiedNode object vs string ID
- Uninitialized shipment variables
- Missing labor hours/costs
- Missing truck assignments
All fixed ‚úÖ
```

## üîß Optional Features (Available but Not Auto-Enabled)

### **FEFO Batch Detail:**
```python
# After solving:
fefo_detail = model.apply_fefo_allocation()

# Returns:
batches = fefo_detail['batches']  # List[Batch] with locations/states
batch_inventory = fefo_detail['batch_inventory']  # By location
allocations = fefo_detail['shipment_allocations']  # FEFO assignments
```
