Date: 2025-10-19

## Test Environment
- Solver: CBC 2.10.12
- Problem Size: 4-week horizon, 5 products, 11 nodes, 10 routes
- Data: Gfree Forecast.xlsm (17,760 demand entries)
- Platform: Linux 6.1.0-40-cloud-amd64

## Executive Summary

**Status: BENCHMARKING IN PROGRESS**

This report documents the performance validation of warmstart functionality for the UnifiedNodeModel optimization. The goal is to measure whether warmstart hints (campaign-based production patterns) provide measurable speedup for binary product_produced variables.

## Test Plan

### Phase 1: Smoke Test (REQUIRED - Fast Validation)
**Purpose:** Verify warmstart integration works correctly
**Timeout:** 10 seconds
**Status:** PENDING

Expected Result:
- ✅ Warmstart generator imports successfully
- ✅ Hint generation completes without errors
- ✅ All hints are binary (0 or 1)
- ✅ UnifiedNodeModel has warmstart methods

### Phase 2: Baseline Performance (Binary WITHOUT Warmstart)
**Purpose:** Establish baseline solve time
**Timeout:** 300 seconds
**Status:** PENDING

Metrics to capture:
- Solve time: [PENDING]s
- Objective value: $[PENDING]
- MIP gap: [PENDING]%
- Status: [PENDING]
- Fill rate: [PENDING]%

### Phase 3: Warmstart Performance (Binary WITH Campaign Hints)
**Purpose:** Measure warmstart effectiveness
**Timeout:** 300 seconds
**Status:** PENDING

Metrics to capture:
- Solve time: [PENDING]s
- Objective value: $[PENDING]
- MIP gap: [PENDING]%
- Status: [PENDING]
- Fill rate: [PENDING]%
- Warmstart generation time: [PENDING]s
- Variables initialized: [PENDING]

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Benchmark
**Purpose:** Side-by-side comparison with detailed metrics
**Timeout:** 600 seconds
**Status:** PENDING

Expected output:
- Detailed comparison table
- Speedup calculation
- Solution quality comparison
- benchmark_results.txt file

### Phase 5: Performance Tests (Pytest Suite)
**Purpose:** Automated validation of warmstart effectiveness
**Timeout:** 600 seconds
**Status:** PENDING

Tests:
- test_warmstart_performance_improvement: Speedup validation
- test_warmstart_campaign_pattern_validation: Pattern correctness

## Performance Comparison

### Baseline Performance (Binary WITHOUT Warmstart)
- Solve time: [PENDING]s
- Objective value: $[PENDING]
- MIP gap: [PENDING]%
- Status: [PENDING]
- Fill rate: [PENDING]%

### Warmstart Performance (Binary WITH Campaign Hints)
- Solve time: [PENDING]s
- Objective value: $[PENDING]
- MIP gap: [PENDING]%
- Status: [PENDING]
- Fill rate: [PENDING]%
- Warmstart generation time: [PENDING]s
- Variables initialized: [PENDING]

### Performance Delta
- Time reduction: [PENDING]s ([PENDING]%)
- Speedup factor: [PENDING]x
- Solution quality change: [PENDING]%
- Warmstart overhead: [PENDING]s

## Conclusion

**Warmstart Effectiveness: PENDING**

Target metrics:
- ✅ Both approaches complete successfully: [PENDING]
- ✅ Warmstart provides ≥10% speedup: [PENDING]
- ✅ Solve time <120s (with warmstart): [PENDING]
- ✅ Objective values within 5%: [PENDING]
- ✅ Fill rates ≥85%: [PENDING]

**Recommendation: PENDING**

Possible outcomes:
1. **ENABLE WARMSTART** - If speedup ≥20% and solve time <120s
2. **CONDITIONAL USE** - If speedup 10-20%, use for large problems only
3. **DISABLE WARMSTART** - If speedup <10% or warmstart causes slowdown
4. **INVESTIGATE FURTHER** - If results inconclusive or timeouts occur

## Detailed Findings

[To be populated after benchmark execution]

## Next Steps

1. Execute run_benchmarks.sh to capture all metrics
2. Update this report with actual performance data
3. Analyze speedup effectiveness and make recommendation
4. Document warmstart configuration in CLAUDE.md if effective
5. Update UI Planning Tab to expose warmstart option if recommended

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Phase 1: Smoke test
venv/bin/python test_warmstart_smoke.py

# Phase 2: Baseline (no warmstart)
timeout 300 venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py::test_ui_workflow_4_weeks_with_initial_inventory -v -s

# Phase 3: Warmstart test
timeout 300 venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py::test_ui_workflow_with_warmstart -v -s

# Phase 4: Benchmark script
timeout 600 python scripts/benchmark_warmstart_performance.py

# Phase 5: Performance tests
timeout 600 venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_warmstart_performance_comparison.py -v -s

# Full suite
bash run_benchmarks.sh
```

## Appendix: Variable Counts

The warmstart targets binary `product_produced[node, product, date]` variables:
- Manufacturing nodes: 1 (node 6122)
- Products: 5
- Production dates: 28 (4 weeks)
- **Total binary variables:** 1 × 5 × 28 = 140 variables

Campaign pattern warmstart initializes ~70-100 of these variables (weekdays only, 2-3 SKUs per day).

## Appendix: Expected Performance

Based on project history:
- **Continuous production variables (baseline):** ~20-30s solve time
- **Binary production variables (no warmstart):** Unknown (first test)
- **Binary production variables (with warmstart):** Expected 10-40% speedup
- **Pallet-based holding costs enabled:** Adds ~18,675 integer variables (2x slowdown)

Current configuration in Network_Config.xlsx:
- Pallet storage costs: 0.0 (DISABLED for fast testing)
- Unit storage costs: 0.1 frozen, 0.002 ambient (ENABLED)
- Expected solve time: 20-30s baseline (continuous), TBD with binary
