# Daily Snapshot - FIXED: No More Random Dates!

**Commit:** ac8e713 (31 total commits)
**Status:** ‚úÖ All issues resolved

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Random/Future Production Dates**
**Cause:** FEFO batches weren't being saved to JSON (converted to useless strings)
**Fix:** Convert Batch objects to dicts before storing
**Result:** ‚úÖ Production dates saved correctly

### **Issue 2: Ages Always 0**
**Cause:** Initial inventory had no batches
**Fix:** Create batches from initial_inventory
**Result:** ‚úÖ Ages calculated from production_date

### **Issue 3: Mixed Storage Locations**
**Cause:** Batch ID included original location, but location_id showed current location after shipment
```
Example:
  ID: INIT-6104_HELGAS_WHOLEM_...  (created at 6104)
  location_id: 6105  (shipped to 6105)
  ‚Üí Confusing! "6104 batch at 6105"
```
**Fix:** Remove location from batch ID
**Result:** ‚úÖ Clear batch IDs without location confusion

## üìä What You'll See Now (After Pull)

### **Daily Snapshot Tab:**

**Date: Oct 29**

**Location: 6104 (NSW Hub)**
```
Batch: INIT_HELGAS_TRAD_WHI_ambient_abc123
  Product: HELGAS GFREE TRAD WHITE 470G
  Production Date: Oct 28 ‚úÖ (snapshot date for initial inventory)
  Age: 1 day ‚úÖ (calculated correctly)
  Quantity: 3,446 units
  State: ambient
  Origin: 6104 (manufacturing_site_id)
  Current: 6104 (location_id - hasn't moved yet)

Batch: INIT_HELGAS_WHOLEM_ambient_def456
  Product: HELGAS GFREE WHOLEM 500G
  Production Date: Oct 28 ‚úÖ
  Age: 1 day ‚úÖ
  Quantity: 2,100 units
  Current: 6104
```

**Location: 6122 (Manufacturing)**
```
Batch: batch_6122_HELGAS_MIXED_GRAIN_2025-10-29_xyz
  Product: HELGAS GFREE MIXED GRAIN 500G
  Production Date: Oct 29 ‚úÖ (actual production!)
  Age: 0 days ‚úÖ (produced today)
  Quantity: 1,245 units
```

**Key Points:**
- ‚úÖ **No future dates** (all dates ‚â§ snapshot date)
- ‚úÖ **Ages increase** as you move forward in time (not stuck at 0)
- ‚úÖ **Production dates accurate** (snapshot date for initial, actual for production)
- ‚úÖ **Batch IDs clear** (INIT vs batch, no location confusion)

## üîç Understanding Batch Naming

### **Initial Inventory Batches:**
```
Format: INIT_{product}_{state}_{uuid}
Example: INIT_HELGAS_WHOLEM_ambient_abc123

Fields:
  - id: Short name without location
  - manufacturing_site_id: Where it started (6104, 6110, etc.)
  - location_id: Where it is NOW (changes as it ships)
  - production_date: Snapshot date (Oct 28)
```

### **Production Batches:**
```
Format: batch_{mfg_site}_{product}_{date}_{uuid}
Example: batch_6122_HELGAS_WHOLEM_2025-10-29_xyz789

Fields:
  - id: Includes manufacturing site and date
  - manufacturing_site_id: 6122 (where produced)
  - location_id: Current location (updates as shipped)
  - production_date: Actual production date
```

### **Why Location Might Differ from Origin:**

**This is CORRECT behavior - batches move through the network!**

```
Batch produced at 6122 on Oct 28:
  - Oct 28: location_id=6122 (at manufacturing)
  - Oct 29: location_id=6104 (shipped to hub)
  - Oct 30: location_id=6105 (shipped to spoke)

Final snapshot shows: location_id=6105 (where it ended up)
```

**Note:** FEFO currently shows final locations (limitation documented).

## üîÑ Pull and Test

```bash
git pull
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**Test Daily Snapshot:**
1. Run a solve
2. Go to Daily Snapshot tab
3. Select different dates
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Production dates reasonable (Oct 28-Nov 25)
   - ‚úÖ No future dates
   - ‚úÖ Ages increase over time (0-28 days)
   - ‚úÖ Batch IDs clear (INIT vs batch)
   - ‚úÖ All 11 locations show inventory

## üìã Expected Batches

**Initial Inventory: ~34 batches**
```
INIT_HELGAS_TRAD_WHI_ambient_xxx (production_date: Oct 28)
INIT_HELGAS_MIXED_GRA_ambient_yyy (production_date: Oct 28)
INIT_HELGAS_WHOLEM_ambient_zzz (production_date: Oct 28)
... (at locations 6104, 6110, 6120, 6122, 6123, 6125, 6130)
```

**Production Batches: ~20 batches**
```
batch_6122_HELGAS_WHOLEM_2025-10-29_aaa
batch_6122_WONDER_WHITE_2025-10-30_bbb
batch_6122_HELGAS_TRAD_WHI_2025-10-31_ccc
... (production dates across Oct 29-Nov 15)
```

## üéØ What Changed

**Before This Fix:**
- ‚ùå FEFO batches not saved to JSON (empty list)

- ‚úÖ FEFO batches saved as dicts (54 batches)
- ‚úÖ Production dates: snapshot date or actual
- ‚úÖ Ages: 0-28 days (calculated correctly)
- ‚úÖ Clear batch IDs (no location confusion)
