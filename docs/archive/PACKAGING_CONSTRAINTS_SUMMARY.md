# Packaging Constraints Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented packaging constraints in the integrated production-distribution optimization model at:
`/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Import (Line 42)
```python
from pyomo.environ import (
    ...
    NonNegativeIntegers,  # NEW
    ...
)
```

### 2. Production Case Constraint (Lines 1281-1299)

**New Variable:**
```python
model.production_cases = Var(
    model.dates,
    model.products,
    within=NonNegativeIntegers,
    doc="Number of cases produced (10 units per case)"
)
```

**New Constraint:**
```python
production[d, p] = production_cases[d, p] * 10
```

**Purpose:** Ensures production only in whole cases (10 units per case)

### 3. Pallet Variables and Constraints (Lines 1379-1390, 2156-2206)

**New Variable:**
```python
model.pallets_loaded = Var(
    model.trucks,
    model.truck_destinations,
    model.products,
    model.dates,
    within=NonNegativeIntegers,
    doc="Number of pallets loaded (320 units per pallet)"
)
```

**New Constraints:**

a) **Pallet Lower Bound (Lines 2156-2170):**
```python
pallets_loaded[truck, dest, prod, d] * 320 >= truck_load[truck, dest, prod, d]
```
Ensures enough pallets to hold all units (implements ceiling function)

b) **Pallet Upper Bound (Lines 2172-2186):**
```python
pallets_loaded[truck, dest, prod, d] * 320 <= truck_load[truck, dest, prod, d] + 319
```
Prevents over-allocation of pallets

c) **Pallet Capacity (Lines 2188-2206):**
```python
sum(pallets_loaded) <= truck_pallet_capacity * truck_used
```
Limits total pallets on truck (typically 44 pallets)

## Mathematical Correctness

The lower and upper bounds together enforce:
```
pallets_loaded = ceil(truck_load / 320)
```

**Proof:**
- Lower: `pallets_loaded >= truck_load / 320`
- Upper: `pallets_loaded <= truck_load / 320 + 0.997`
- Since pallets_loaded is integer: `pallets_loaded = ceil(truck_load / 320)`

## Examples

### Example 1: Small Load
- truck_load = 100 units
- pallets_loaded >= 0.3125 → pallets_loaded = 1
- pallets_loaded * 320 <= 419 → pallets_loaded <= 1.31
- Result: pallets_loaded = 1 ✓

### Example 2: Exact Full Pallet
- truck_load = 320 units
- pallets_loaded >= 1.0 → pallets_loaded = 1
- pallets_loaded * 320 <= 639 → pallets_loaded <= 1.997
- Result: pallets_loaded = 1 ✓

### Example 3: Just Over Full Pallet
- truck_load = 321 units
- pallets_loaded >= 1.003 → pallets_loaded = 2
- pallets_loaded * 320 <= 640 → pallets_loaded <= 2.0
- Result: pallets_loaded = 2 ✓

### Example 4: Pallet Capacity Binding
- Scenario: Load 44 pallets with 10 units each
- truck_load = 440 units (3.1% of 14,080 unit capacity)
- pallets_loaded = 44 (100% of pallet capacity)
- **Pallet constraint binds, not unit constraint**

## Solver Considerations

**Additional Variables:**
- production_cases: ~400-600 integers
- pallets_loaded: ~20,000-40,000 integers

**Additional Constraints:**
- production_case_link_con: ~400-600
- pallet_lower_bound_con: ~20,000-40,000
- pallet_upper_bound_con: ~20,000-40,000
- pallet_capacity_con: ~200-300

**Expected Solve Time Impact:**
- CBC: 2-5x longer (recommend 5-10 minute time limit)
- Gurobi/CPLEX: 30-120 seconds for typical instances

**Status:** Implementation complete, syntax validated ✓
