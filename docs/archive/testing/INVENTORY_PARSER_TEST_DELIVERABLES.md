## Overview

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. Unit Conversion Tests (5 tests)
- ✅ EA units use 1:1 conversion
- ✅ CAS units use 10:1 conversion (10 units per case)

- ✅ Various quantity values (fractional, large, very large)
- ✅ Conversion accuracy with pytest.approx()

### 2. Case-Insensitive Unit Handling (2 tests)
- ✅ All variations of EA and CAS (ea, EA, Ea, eA, cas, CAS, Cas, etc.)
- ✅ Correct conversion applied regardless of case

### 3. Unknown Unit Type Handling (2 tests)

## Test Architecture

### Fixtures
1. **create_test_excel_file** - Factory fixture for creating test Excel files
   - Creates temporary Excel files with specified data
   - Returns Path object
   - Automatic cleanup via pytest tmp_path

2. **mock_product_alias_resolver** - Mock resolver for testing alias resolution
   - Maps 999999 → 176283
   - Maps 888888 → 168846
   - Implements resolve_product_id() and is_mapped() methods

### Test Organization
- Tests organized into logical sections with clear headers
- Each section focuses on specific functionality
- Parameterized tests for variations
- Warning capture using pytest warnings.catch_warnings()
- Clear docstrings explaining test purpose

### Best Practices Applied
✅ Use pytest fixtures for common test data
✅ Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
✅ Warning validation with warnings.catch_warnings()
✅ Clear test names following convention: test_<what>_<expected_behavior>
✅ Comprehensive docstrings
✅ Separation of concerns (each test focuses on one aspect)
✅ Edge case coverage
✅ Integration test included
✅ Error condition testing
✅ Boundary condition testing

## Key Behaviors Locked In

### Unit Conversion
- **EA (Each):** Multiply by 1.0
- **CAS (Case):** Multiply by 10.0
- **Unknown:** Multiply by 1.0 with warning
- **Case-insensitive:** EA = ea = Ea = eA

### Data Filtering
- **Storage Location 5000:** Always excluded with warning
- **Negative quantities:** Set to 0 with warning, then skipped (zero)
- **Zero quantities:** Skipped (not included)
- **Null Plant:** Row skipped
- **Null Base Unit:** Treated as unknown (1:1 with warning)

### Aggregation Rules
- **Key:** (location_id, product_id, storage_location)
- **Mixed units:** Converted before aggregation
- **Different plants:** Kept separate
- **Different materials:** Kept separate
- **Storage locations:** Aggregated in to_optimization_dict()

### Validation
- **Required columns:** Material, Plant, Unrestricted, Base Unit of Measure
- **Optional columns:** Storage Location
- **Missing required:** ValueError raised
- **Missing optional:** Handled gracefully (None value)

### Output Format
- **to_optimization_dict():** Returns `Dict[Tuple[str, str], float]`
- **Keys:** (location_id, product_id) tuples
- **Values:** Total quantity in units (float)
- **Aggregation:** Across storage locations

✅ Test negative quantities are handled (set to 0 with warning)
✅ Test zero quantities are skipped
✅ Test aggregation of multiple rows
✅ Test missing required columns raise ValueError
✅ Test product alias resolution
✅ Test the to_optimization_dict() method output

✅ Add parameterized tests for multiple unit types
✅ Test warning messages are emitted correctly
✅ Follow pytest best practices

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Performance tests** - Test with very large files (10,000+ rows)
2. **Concurrent parsing** - Test thread safety if needed
3. **Memory profiling** - Test memory usage with large files
4. **Malformed data tests** - Test with corrupted Excel files
5. **Multi-sheet tests** - Test with multiple sheets in workbook

## Conclusion

The inventory parser unit conversion functionality is now fully tested with 68 comprehensive tests covering:
- All conversion scenarios (EA, CAS, unknown)
- All filtering rules (Storage Location 5000, negative, zero)
- All aggregation behaviors
- All error conditions
- All edge cases
- Integration with product alias resolution
- Output format validation

The tests serve as both **validation** of current behavior and **documentation** of expected behavior for future developers. Any changes to the inventory parser should maintain these test behaviors or update tests with clear justification.
