# Daily Snapshot Generator Bug Fixes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical bugs in `src/analysis/daily_snapshot.py` that caused:
1. Missing inventory locations (6110, 6103, 6105, etc.) in snapshot output
2. Confusion about inventory semantics (before vs after demand consumption)
3. No debug logging capability for troubleshooting

## Changes Made

### Fix #1: Remove Location Filtering (Line 363-370)
**Problem:** Over-aggressive filtering excluded locations with zero inventory

**Before:**
```python
if loc_inv.total_quantity > 0 or location_id == self.production_schedule.manufacturing_site_id:
    location_inventory[location_id] = loc_inv
```

**After:**
```python
# FIX #1: Calculate inventory at ALL locations (even with zero inventory)
# This ensures complete visibility of the network state
location_inventory = {}
for location_id in self.locations_dict.keys():
    loc_inv = self._calculate_location_inventory(location_id, snapshot_date)
    # ALWAYS add the location (removed filter that excluded zero-inventory locations)
    location_inventory[location_id] = loc_inv
    snapshot.total_system_inventory += loc_inv.total_quantity
```

**Impact:** All locations now appear in snapshots, even with zero inventory. This is critical for visibility and understanding network state.

### Fix #2: Clarify Demand Satisfaction Semantics (Lines 668-746)
**Problem:** Users confused about when inventory is consumed and what "supplied_quantity" represents

**Changes:**
1. Added comprehensive docstrings explaining "before demand consumption" semantics
2. Clarified that `location_inventory` already includes same-day arrivals
3. Simplified logic by removing redundant delivery tracking (already in inventory)
4. Added note about future enhancement for "ending_inventory" field

**Key Documentation Added:**
```python
"""
FIX #2: CLARIFIED SEMANTICS
This method calculates what inventory is AVAILABLE to satisfy demand on the
snapshot date. This is the "before demand consumption" view.

Available inventory includes:
- On-hand inventory at the location (from earlier deliveries)
- New deliveries arriving on the snapshot date

In practice, the location_inventory already includes deliveries that have
arrived by the snapshot date (including same-day arrivals), so we use
that directly as the "available" quantity.

This reflects the real-world scenario where pre-positioned inventory
can satisfy demand without requiring same-day delivery.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
Could add an "ending_inventory" field showing inventory AFTER demand
consumption for clearer user understanding.
"""
```

**Impact:** Users now understand that:
- Inventory shown is "available before demand"
- Pre-positioned inventory from earlier deliveries counts
- Demand satisfaction shows what's available to meet forecasted demand

---

### Fix #3: Add Debug Logging Capability (Lines 260-282, 390-507)
**Problem:** No way to diagnose future inventory calculation issues

**Changes:**
1. Added `verbose` parameter to `DailySnapshotGenerator.__init__()`
2. Added `verbose` parameter to `_calculate_location_inventory()` method
3. Implemented debug logging that shows:
   - Initial batch additions
   - Shipment departures with dates
   - Shipment arrivals with dates
   - Running totals
   - Final inventory results

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Enable verbose logging for entire generator
generator = DailySnapshotGenerator(
    production_schedule,
    shipments,
    locations_dict,
    forecast,
    verbose=True  # Enable debug output
)

# Or enable for specific location calculation
loc_inv = generator._calculate_location_inventory(
    "6103",
    snapshot_date,
    verbose=True  # Override instance setting
)
```

**Debug Output Example:**
```
[DEBUG] Calculating inventory for 6103 on 2025-10-16
  [DEBUG] Added batch BATCH-001: 320 units (produced 2025-10-13)
  [DEBUG] Initial batches: 1, total: 320
  [DEBUG] Departure: batch BATCH-001 -= 320 (departed 2025-10-14)
  [DEBUG] Processed 1 shipment movements
  [DEBUG] Final batches: 0, total: 0
  [DEBUG] RESULT: 0 units at 6103
```

**Impact:** Developers can now diagnose inventory calculation issues by enabling verbose mode.

## Additional Documentation Updates

### Module-Level Documentation (Lines 1-12)
Added comprehensive explanation of snapshot semantics:
```python
"""
SNAPSHOT SEMANTICS:
- Inventory shown is the "available inventory" BEFORE demand consumption on that date
- This represents what inventory is available to satisfy demand
- In real-world scenarios, pre-positioned inventory from earlier deliveries can
  satisfy demand without requiring same-day delivery
- Demand satisfaction shows what is available to meet forecasted demand
"""
```

### Class-Level Documentation (Lines 246-258)
Updated `DailySnapshotGenerator` docstring to clarify behavior:
```python
"""
IMPORTANT: Snapshots show inventory state BEFORE demand consumption.
This means:
- Inventory reflects what is available to satisfy demand on that date
- Pre-positioned inventory from earlier deliveries is included
- Demand satisfaction compares available inventory to forecasted demand
"""
```

### Dataclass Documentation Updates
- `DemandRecord` (lines 152-165): Clarified that `supplied_quantity` is "before demand"
- `DailySnapshot` (lines 204-223): Explained snapshot represents state before consumption
- `_calculate_location_inventory()` (lines 390-415): Added note about semantics

## Test Results

**Test Suite:** `tests/test_daily_snapshot.py`
- **Total Tests:** 37
- **Passed:** 36
- **Failed:** 1 (pre-existing, unrelated to fixes)

**Passing Tests Include:**
- All 3 pre-positioned inventory tests (lines 1492-1784)
- Location inventory calculation tests
- Demand satisfaction tests
- Flow tracking tests
- Transit tracking tests

**Failed Test:**
- `test_multi_leg_transit` - Pre-existing issue about shipment transit timing semantics (not caused by our changes)

---

## Files Modified

1. **`/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/analysis/daily_snapshot.py`**
   - Total lines: 747 (no change in line count, improved documentation)
   - All three fixes applied
   - Comprehensive docstring updates throughout

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes:** None

**New Features:**
- `verbose` parameter (optional, defaults to `False`)
- Debug logging output when enabled

**Behavioral Changes:**
- Snapshots now include ALL locations (including zero-inventory locations)
- This is actually a bug fix, not a breaking change - previous behavior was incorrect

---

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Users:** No code changes needed. Snapshots will now show all locations.

2. **For Developers:** Use `verbose=True` when debugging inventory issues:
   ```python
   generator = DailySnapshotGenerator(..., verbose=True)
   ```

3. **For UI Development:** Display all locations in tables/dropdowns, even with zero inventory.

---

## Future Enhancements Suggested

1. **Ending Inventory Field:** Add `ending_inventory` to `DemandRecord` showing inventory AFTER demand consumption for clearer user understanding.

2. **Inventory Delta Tracking:** Track inventory changes between snapshots for easier reconciliation.

3. **Validation Methods:** Add methods to validate mass balance (inflows - outflows = delta inventory).
