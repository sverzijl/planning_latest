## Implementation Details

### 1. Import Added (Line 42)

```python
from pyomo.environ import (
    ConcreteModel,
    Var,
    Constraint,
    Objective,
    NonNegativeReals,
    NonNegativeIntegers,  # ← NEW
    Binary,
    minimize,
    value,
)
```

### 2. Production Case Constraint (Lines 1281-1299)

**Variable:**
```python
model.production_cases = Var(
    model.dates,
    model.products,
    within=NonNegativeIntegers,
    doc="Number of cases produced (10 units per case)"
)
```

**Linking Constraint:**
```python
def production_case_link_rule(model, d, p):
    """Production quantity must equal number of cases times 10 units per case."""
    return model.production[d, p] == model.production_cases[d, p] * 10

model.production_case_link_con = Constraint(
    model.dates,
    model.products,
    rule=production_case_link_rule,
    doc="Production must be in whole cases (10 units per case)"
)
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
production[d, p] = production_cases[d, p] × 10    ∀d ∈ dates, p ∈ products
```

### 3. Pallet Loading Variable (Lines 1379-1390)

```python
model.pallets_loaded = Var(
    model.trucks,
    model.truck_destinations,
    model.products,
    model.dates,
    within=NonNegativeIntegers,
    doc="Number of pallets loaded on truck (320 units per full pallet)"
)
```

### 4. Pallet Constraints (Lines 2156-2206)

#### 4a. Pallet Lower Bound (Lines 2156-2170)

```python
def pallet_lower_bound_rule(model, truck_idx, dest, prod, d):
    """Pallets loaded must be sufficient to hold all units (accounts for partial pallets)."""
    return model.pallets_loaded[truck_idx, dest, prod, d] * 320 >= model.truck_load[truck_idx, dest, prod, d]

model.pallet_lower_bound_con = Constraint(
    model.trucks,
    model.truck_destinations,
    model.products,
    model.dates,
    rule=pallet_lower_bound_rule,
    doc="Pallets must be sufficient to hold truck load (lower bound)"
)
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
pallets_loaded[t, dest, p, d] × 320 ≥ truck_load[t, dest, p, d]
    ∀t ∈ trucks, dest ∈ destinations, p ∈ products, d ∈ dates
```

#### 4b. Pallet Upper Bound (Lines 2172-2186)

```python
def pallet_upper_bound_rule(model, truck_idx, dest, prod, d):
    """Pallets loaded cannot exceed ceiling of units divided by 320."""
    return model.pallets_loaded[truck_idx, dest, prod, d] * 320 <= model.truck_load[truck_idx, dest, prod, d] + 319

model.pallet_upper_bound_con = Constraint(
    model.trucks,
    model.truck_destinations,
    model.products,
    model.dates,
    rule=pallet_upper_bound_rule,
    doc="Pallets cannot exceed ceiling of truck load divided by 320 (upper bound)"
)
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
pallets_loaded[t, dest, p, d] × 320 ≤ truck_load[t, dest, p, d] + 319
    ∀t ∈ trucks, dest ∈ destinations, p ∈ products, d ∈ dates
```

#### 4c. Pallet Capacity (Lines 2188-2206)

```python
def pallet_capacity_rule(model, truck_idx, d):
    """Total pallets on truck (across all destinations and products) cannot exceed pallet capacity."""
    total_pallets = sum(
        model.pallets_loaded[truck_idx, dest, p, d]
        for dest in model.truck_destinations
        for p in model.products
    )
    pallet_capacity = self.truck_pallet_capacity[truck_idx]
    return total_pallets <= pallet_capacity * model.truck_used[truck_idx, d]

model.pallet_capacity_con = Constraint(
    model.trucks,
    model.dates,
    rule=pallet_capacity_rule,
    doc="Pallet capacity constraint (sum across all destinations and products)"
)
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Σ(dest,p) pallets_loaded[t, dest, p, d] ≤ pallet_capacity[t] × truck_used[t, d]
    ∀t ∈ trucks, d ∈ dates
```

Where `pallet_capacity[t]` is typically 44 pallets.

## Mathematical Proof: Ceiling Function

The lower and upper bounds together enforce `pallets_loaded = ceil(truck_load / 320)`:

**Lower bound:**
```
pallets_loaded ≥ truck_load / 320
```

**Upper bound:**
```
pallets_loaded ≤ (truck_load + 319) / 320 = truck_load/320 + 0.997
```

**Result:**
Since `pallets_loaded` is an integer, the only integer values that satisfy both bounds are:
```
pallets_loaded = ceil(truck_load / 320)
```

**Validation:** All test cases pass (see validation output below)

## Validation Results

```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - Pallet bounds correctly implement ceiling function

Test cases validated:
- truck_load = 0 → 0 pallets
- truck_load = 1 → 1 pallet (partial pallet waste)
- truck_load = 100 → 1 pallet
- truck_load = 319 → 1 pallet
- truck_load = 320 → 1 pallet (full pallet, no waste)
- truck_load = 321 → 2 pallets
- truck_load = 640 → 2 pallets
- truck_load = 14080 → 44 pallets (full truck)
```

## Constraint Interaction

### Existing Constraints (Maintained)

**Truck Unit Capacity (Line 2149-2154):**
```python
Σ(dest,p) truck_load[t, dest, p, d] ≤ capacity[t] × truck_used[t, d]
```
Where `capacity[t] = 14,080 units`

**Interaction:**
- Both unit capacity AND pallet capacity must be satisfied
- Pallet capacity is typically MORE RESTRICTIVE due to partial pallet waste
- Example: 44 pallets × 10 units each = 440 units << 14,080 unit limit

## Performance Considerations

### Additional Model Size

**Integer Variables Added:**
- `production_cases`: |dates| × |products| ≈ 400-600 variables
- `pallets_loaded`: |trucks| × |destinations| × |products| × |dates| ≈ 20,000-40,000 variables

**Total:** ~20,000-40,000 additional integer variables

**Constraints Added:**
- `production_case_link_con`: ≈ 400-600
- `pallet_lower_bound_con`: ≈ 20,000-40,000
- `pallet_upper_bound_con`: ≈ 20,000-40,000
- `pallet_capacity_con`: ≈ 200-300

**Total:** ~40,000-80,000 additional constraints

### Expected Solve Times

**CBC (open-source):**
- Small instances (3-7 days): 30-180 seconds
- Medium instances (14 days): 2-5 minutes
- Large instances (30 days): 5-10 minutes
- Recommend time limit: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

**Gurobi/CPLEX (commercial):**
- Small instances: 5-15 seconds
- Medium instances: 15-45 seconds
- Large instances: 30-120 seconds
- Significantly better MILP performance

### Optimization Tips

1. **Start with smaller horizons** (7-14 days) before scaling to 30+ days
2. **Use production smoothing** to reduce day-to-day variation
3. **Set realistic upper bounds** on production_cases based on demand forecasts
4. **Enable solver logging** to monitor progress
5. **Consider warm-starting** with LP relaxation solution

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Load with Waste

**Demand:** 157 units

**Solution:**
- production_cases = 16 (forced by case constraint)
- production = 160 units
- truck_load = 160 units
- pallets_loaded = 1 pallet (ceil(160/320))
- Waste: 3 units (due to case rounding)
- Truck utilization: 1/44 pallets = 2.3%

### Scenario 2: Multiple Products with Partial Pallets

**Scenario:** 3 products on one truck
- Product A: 100 units → 1 pallet
- Product B: 500 units → 2 pallets (320 + 180)
- Product C: 50 units → 1 pallet

**Solution:**
- Total pallets: 4
- Total units: 650
- Pallet utilization: 4/44 = 9.1%
- Unit utilization: 650/14,080 = 4.6%

**Key insight:** Pallet constraint binds (4 ≤ 44 ✓), not unit constraint (650 ≤ 14,080)

### Scenario 3: Pallet Capacity Binding

**Scenario:** Maximum pallet loading

**Try to load:**
- 44 pallets with 1 case each (10 units per pallet)

**Result:**
- pallets_loaded = 44 ✓ AT CAPACITY
- truck_load = 440 units
- Unit capacity: 440/14,080 = 3.1% utilized
- Pallet capacity: 44/44 = 100% utilized ✓ BINDING

**Cannot load more,** even though unit capacity allows 14,080 units!

## Design Rationale: Hybrid Approach

### Why Not Make truck_load Discrete?

**Rejected Alternative:** Require truck_load ∈ {0, 10, 20, 30, ...}

**Why Rejected:**
1. Would add ~20,000-40,000 integer variables (truck_load is 4-dimensional)
2. Much harder to solve (4D integer vs 2D integer + continuous)
3. Provides no additional benefit since pallets_loaded already captures discrete space

**Chosen Approach:**
- Production is discrete (production_cases)
- Truck loading is continuous (truck_load)
- Pallet space is discrete (pallets_loaded)

This hybrid approach:
- ✓ Minimizes integer variables
- ✓ Maintains mathematical correctness
- ✓ Remains solvable with CBC
- ✓ Accurately represents packaging constraints

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests to Add

1. **Test production_cases linking:**
   ```python
   def test_production_cases_constraint():
       # Verify production is always multiple of 10
       assert all(prod % 10 == 0 for prod in production_values)
   ```

2. **Test pallet ceiling:**
   ```python
   def test_pallet_ceiling():
       # Verify pallets = ceil(truck_load / 320)
       for load in truck_loads:
           assert pallets_loaded == math.ceil(load / 320)
   ```

3. **Test pallet capacity:**
   ```python
   def test_pallet_capacity():
       # Verify sum(pallets) <= 44 when truck used
       assert sum(pallets_loaded) <= 44
   ```

### Integration Tests

1. **Small instance** (3 days, 2 products): Should solve < 30 seconds
2. **Medium instance** (7 days, 5 products): Should solve < 3 minutes
3. **Large instance** (30 days, 5 products): Should solve < 10 minutes with CBC

## Future Enhancements

   - Small penalty for partial pallets
   - Encourages filling pallets when possible

2. **Full-pallet production targets:**
   - Encourage production in multiples of 320
   - Reduce partial pallet waste

3. **Dynamic pallet sizing:**
   - Support different pallet sizes by truck type
   - Already supported via truck_pallet_capacity dictionary

### Reporting Enhancements

1. **Pallet utilization dashboard:**
   - Show fill rates by truck
   - Identify consolidation opportunities

2. **Packaging efficiency metrics:**
   - Case utilization
   - Pallet utilization
   - Truck pallet utilization
