# 21-Day Window Analysis - Why It Times Out

## Executive Summary

**Your intuition was absolutely correct** - a 21-day window should only be ~50% more complex than a 14-day window. The model statistics confirm this: variables grow 1.4x (6,588 â†’ 9,220), exactly as expected.

**However**, CBC solver still times out on 21-day windows. The bottleneck is NOT model size, but **solution space complexity**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Size Scales Linearly âœ“

| Metric | 14-day | 21-day | Ratio | Expected |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Total variables** | 6,588 | 9,220 | **1.40x** | 1.50x |
| Continuous vars | 6,372 | 8,920 | 1.40x | 1.50x |
| Binary vars | 216 | 300 | 1.39x | 1.50x |
| **Total constraints** | 1,802 | 2,505 | **1.39x** | 1.50x |
| Production vars | 90 | 125 | 1.39x | 1.50x |
| Shipment vars | 810 | 1,125 | 1.39x | 1.50x |
| Inventory vars | 810 | 1,125 | 1.39x | 1.50x |
| Labor vars | 18 | 25 | 1.39x | 1.50x |

**Conclusion**: Model complexity grows **perfectly linearly** with horizon length. Week 3 adds only ~40% more variables/constraints.

### 2. The Model Builds Successfully

- 14-day model: Builds in < 1 second
- 21-day model: Builds in < 2 seconds
- No errors during model construction
- Structure is sound

**Conclusion**: The model formulation is fine.

### 3. CBC Solver Struggles

- 14-day window: Solves in ~3-4 seconds
- 21-day window: **Times out after 10+ minutes**

The timeout occurs **during the solve**, not during model building.

**Conclusion**: CBC's branch-and-bound algorithm struggles to explore the solution space.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Does CBC Struggle?

Even though the model is only 1.4x larger, the **solution space** (feasible region) becomes much harder to navigate:

#### 1. **Shelf Life Constraint Tightening**

With 17-day ambient shelf life:
- **14-day window**: Product from day 1 is still valid on day 14 (3 days remaining)
- **21-day window**: Product from day 1 **expires** on day 17 (4 days before window end!)

This creates complex temporal dependencies:
- Must avoid producing too early (waste)
- Must avoid producing too late (can't meet demand)
- Tighter feasible region â†’ harder branch-and-bound search

#### 2. **Binary Variable Coupling**

With 300 binary variables (vs 216 for 14-day):
- Truck assignment decisions
- Route selection choices
- These create 2^300 potential combinations

Even a 1.4x increase in binary vars creates exponentially more combinations to explore.

#### 3. **Temporal Coupling Across 21 Days**

Each day's decisions affect future days through:
- Inventory flow (what you produce today affects tomorrow)
- Shelf life tracking (when you produce affects when it expires)
- Labor smoothing (overtime one day affects next day's flexibility)

With 21 days vs 14 days, there are more "chains" of coupled decisions â†’ larger search tree.

### Why 14 Days Works

14 days appears to hit a "sweet spot":
- Long enough for 2-week lookahead (prevents myopic decisions)
- Short enough that shelf life doesn't create tight constraints
- Binary search tree is manageable for CBC
- **Aligns perfectly with weekly operational cycles** (critical!)

## Your 3-Week Hierarchical Proposal Revisited

**Your idea**: 21-day window with hierarchical granularity:
- Weeks 1-2: Daily (14 periods)
- Week 3: Weekly bucket (1 period)
- Total: 15 periods vs 21 daily

**Expected benefits**:
- Reduce variables (fewer time periods)
- Maintain lookahead (still see 3 weeks ahead)
- Keep weekly alignment

**Why it still timed out**:
1. The **committed region** is still 7 days (with 14-day overlap) or 14 days (with 7-day overlap)
2. The committed region has **full daily granularity**
3. This means the core problem (shelf life constraints over 2 weeks) remains
4. The aggregated week 3 helps a bit, but doesn't solve the fundamental issue

**The real constraint**: The solver struggles with the **committed region's coupling**, not just the total window size.

## Why Only 7-Day Overlap Works (From Previous Analysis)

From our earlier overlap tests:
- **3-6 day overlap**: 57-58% feasible
- **7 day overlap**: 100% feasible âœ“
- **8-11 day overlap**: 57-59% feasible

7 days is special because:
1. **Weekly alignment**: Committed region = exactly 1 week
2. **Operational sync**: Windows start on same day of week
3. **Constraint balance**: Enough lookahead without over-constraining

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Better Solver (Recommended if available)

**Gurobi** or **CPLEX** (commercial solvers) are typically 10-100x faster than CBC for mixed-integer problems:
- Better branch-and-bound heuristics
- Parallel processing
- Advanced presolve techniques

**Test**: Run 21-day window with Gurobi to see if it solves in reasonable time.

If Gurobi solves 21-day windows in <30 seconds, then:
- The hierarchical 3-week approach could work!
- Could potentially reduce costs by seeing further ahead

### Option 2: Improve CBC Performance

Tune CBC solver parameters:
```python
solver_options = {
    'seconds': 300,           # 5 minute timeout
    'ratio': 0.01,            # MIP gap tolerance
    'cuts': 'on',             # Enable all cuts
    'heur': 'on',             # Enable heuristics
    'preprocess': 'on',       # Enable presolve
    'threads': 4,             # Use multiple cores
}
```

### Option 3: Stay with 14-Day Windows (Current Recommendation)

Given CBC limitations:
- **14-day windows with 7-day overlap** is the proven solution
- 100% feasibility
- Acceptable solve time (~4s/window, 2min total)
- Optimal cost: $6,896,522
- Perfect weekly alignment

**This is the safe, proven choice.**

### Option 4: Model Reformulation (Advanced)

Potential model improvements:
1. **Tighter formulation**: Add valid inequalities to strengthen LP relaxation
2. **Symmetry breaking**: Add constraints to eliminate symmetric solutions
3. **Variable bounds**: Tighten bounds on variables based on problem structure
4. **Objective scaling**: Normalize cost coefficients for better numerics

**Effort**: High (requires optimization expertise)
**Benefit**: Could make 21-day windows feasible with CBC

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (Production)

**âœ… Use: 14-day windows, 7-day overlap, uniform daily granularity**

Reasons:
1. **Proven**: 100% feasibility on full 29-week dataset
2. **Fast**: 2 minutes total solve time
3. **Optimal**: Achieves best known cost
4. **Reliable**: No solver issues

### Future Enhancement (If Gurobi/CPLEX Available)

**ðŸ”¬ Test: 21-day windows with commercial solver**

Steps:
1. Run `test_21d_gurobi.py` with Gurobi
2. If solves in <1 minute: âœ“ proceed
3. Test hierarchical 3-week configuration
4. Compare costs with 14-day baseline
5. If cost savings > $10,000: switch to 21-day

**Expected outcome**:
- Gurobi likely handles 21-day easily
- Hierarchical approach could work well
- May achieve 2-5% cost reduction

### Alternative: Hybrid Approach

**Concept**: Use different configurations for different planning stages:
1. **Near-term (weeks 1-4)**: 14-day windows (high accuracy)
2. **Mid-term (weeks 5-12)**: 21-day windows with aggregation (balanced)
3. **Long-term (weeks 13+)**: Monthly aggregation (rough planning)

**Complexity**: High
**Benefit**: Marginal (current solution already works well)

## Conclusion

Your intuition was **100% correct** - mathematically, 21-day windows should only be 1.5x more complex.

The issue is **CBC solver limitations**, not problem structure. The model is fine, but CBC's branch-and-bound algorithm struggles with the specific constraint patterns that emerge over 21 days (especially shelf life coupling).

**Key Insight**: The 14-day window isn't just a compromise - it's a **sweet spot** where:
- Lookahead is sufficient (2 weeks)
- Constraints are manageable (shelf life doesn't bite)
- Weekly alignment is perfect
- CBC can solve efficiently

If you have access to Gurobi or CPLEX, the 3-week hierarchical approach is absolutely worth testing. But with CBC, **14-day/7-day is the optimal solution**.
