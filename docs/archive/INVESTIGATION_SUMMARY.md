# Production Planning Investigation Summary

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** The monolithic solve is the superior approach - solves entire 29-week horizon optimally in 104 seconds. The rolling horizon has fundamental bugs producing only ~42-50% of required units.

## 1. Route Feasibility Analysis ✅

**All routes are shelf-life feasible:**

| Destination | Transit | Shelf Life Remaining | Mode    |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 6103        | 2.0d    | 15d                | Ambient |
| 6104        | 1.0d    | 16d                | Ambient |
| 6105        | 1.5d    | 16d                | Ambient |
| 6110        | 1.5d    | 16d                | Ambient |
| 6120        | 3.0d    | 14d                | Ambient |
| 6123        | 1.5d    | 16d                | Ambient |
| 6125        | 1.0d    | 16d                | Ambient |
| 6130        | 3.5d    | 14d                | Frozen  |
| 6134        | 2.5d    | 14d                | Ambient |

**Conclusion:** 9/9 routes feasible (100%). No routes filtered due to shelf life constraints.

## 2. Monolithic Solve Performance

**Configuration:** Full 29-week horizon (203 days, June 2 - Dec 22, 2025)

**Results:**
- **Status:** Optimal (within 1% gap)
- **Solve time:** 104 seconds (1.7 minutes)
- **Objective value:** $13,313,044
- **Production:** 2,252,419 units
- **Shortage cost:** $0

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Labor: $49,030 (0.4%)
- Production: $11,262,095 (84.6%)
- Transport: $1,170,141 (8.8%)
- Inventory: $21,609 (0.2%)
- Truck: $810,169 (6.1%)
- **TOTAL:** $13,313,044

**Mystery:** Production (2,252,419) is 6.4% less than total demand (2,407,299), yet shortage cost is $0. Gap is EXACTLY 11 trucks × 14,080 units = 154,880 units. This suggests end-of-horizon constraint.

## 3. Rolling Horizon Results

### Window Configurations Tested

| Configuration | Windows | Production | % of Demand | Solve Time | Reported Cost |
|---------------|---------|------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 14d/7d        | 29      | 1,013,897  | 42%         | ~100s      | $7,123,247   |
| 21d/14d       | 28      | 1,058,350  | 44%         | ~120s      | $7,402,659   |
| 28d/21d       | 27      | 1,065,331  | 44%         | 198s       | $7,399,284   |
| 56d/49d       | 23      | 1,211,207  | 50%         | 343s       | $8,165,224   |

**Critical Bugs Identified:**

1. **Production Shortfall:** Rolling horizon only produces 42-50% of required demand
   - Total demand: 2,407,299 units
   - Best case (56d/49d): 1,211,207 units (50%)
   - Shortfall: ~1.2M units (fundamental stitching bug)

2. **Cost Reporting Artifact:** Reported costs include prorating errors
   - Independent cost calculation (14d/7d): $5,091,955
   - Reported by RH: $7,123,247
   - Difference: $2.0M+ (40% inflation due to prorating)

### Cost Calculation Fix

**Fixed in `rolling_horizon_solver.py`:**
- **Old approach:** Prorated all costs uniformly by committed days ratio
- **New approach:**
  - Labor cost: Exact (sum only committed dates)
  - Production cost: Exact (calculate from committed production)
  - Transport/inventory/other: Prorated (approximation)

**Result:** Actual costs differ by production volume (~4%), not fundamental decisions. Configurations are economically equivalent.

### Window Creation Fix

**Fixed in `window_config.py`:**
- **Bug:** Windows created beyond planning horizon, causing overlapping final windows
- **Impact:** 14d/7d created 30 windows instead of 29, inflating costs by ~$2M
- **Fix:** Early termination when `is_last` flag is true

## 4. Key Insights

### Monolithic vs Rolling Horizon

**Monolithic Advantages:**
1. **True global optimum:** No window boundary artifacts
2. **Simpler implementation:** No stitching complexity
3. **Faster:** 104s vs 100-343s for rolling horizon
4. **Correct output:** Produces expected volumes (within 6.4%)

**Rolling Horizon Issues:**
1. **Fundamental bugs:** Only producing 42-50% of demand
2. **Stitching complexity:** Prone to errors in solution assembly
3. **Cost reporting:** Requires careful prorating to avoid artifacts
4. **No clear benefit:** Doesn't solve faster or better than monolithic

### The 154,880 Unit Mystery

**Observation:** Gap between production and demand is EXACTLY 11 trucks

- Total demand: 2,407,299 units
- Monolithic production: 2,252,419 units
- Gap: 154,880 units = 11 × 14,080 units/truck

**Hypotheses:**
1. End-of-horizon constraint: Demand on Dec 19-22 can't be met
2. Last 14 days demand: 167,718 units (~93% of gap)
3. Planning horizon doesn't extend END date (only START)
4. Production must happen BEFORE delivery date

**But:** Shortage cost is $0, suggesting model thinks it's meeting demand. Further investigation needed to resolve this discrepancy.

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Action

**Use monolithic solve for production:**
- Proven optimal solution in reasonable time (104s)
- No stitching bugs or cost artifacts
- Handles full 29-week horizon in single solve

### Future Investigation

1. **Resolve 154,880 unit mystery:**
   - Compare actual deliveries vs forecast demand
   - Check if model is building ending inventory
   - Verify horizon extension logic for end-of-planning period

2. **Fix or retire rolling horizon:**
   - Fundamental bugs in stitching logic losing 50%+ of production
   - Only worth fixing if needed for >29 week horizons
   - Current implementation not production-ready

3. **Validate monolithic solution:**
   - Verify 100% demand satisfaction
   - Confirm production-delivery matching
   - Understand inventory vs shortage accounting
