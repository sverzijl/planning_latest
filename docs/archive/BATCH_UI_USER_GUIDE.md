# Batch Tracking UI - User Guide

## Introduction

The enhanced Daily Inventory Snapshot now displays comprehensive batch-level tracking information, including production dates, age, shelf life remaining, and complete traceability through the supply chain network.

This guide explains how to use the new batch tracking features.

## Prerequisites

### Enable Batch Tracking

To see batch-level information, ensure batch tracking is enabled when running optimization:

```python
# When calling the optimization model
results = model.solve(
    use_batch_tracking=True,  # Enable batch tracking
    ...
)
```

### Required Data

The batch tracking UI requires:
- Production schedule with batch information
- Shipments with batch_id assignments
- Model solution with cohort_inventory (optional, for current locations)

## Feature 1: Enhanced Batch Inventory Display

### Accessing Batch Information

1. Navigate to **Daily Inventory Snapshot** in the Streamlit UI
2. Select a date using the date slider
3. Expand a location to view inventory details

### Understanding the Batch Table

Each batch displays the following information:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Batch ID** | Unique identifier for the batch | BATCH-2025-10-01-176283-001 |
| **Product** | Product ID | 176283 |
| **Quantity** | Units in batch at this location | 1,200 |
| **Production Date** | When batch was manufactured | 2025-10-01 |
| **Age (days)** | Days since production | 3d |
| **Shelf Life Left** | Days until expiration | 14d |
| **Status** | Freshness indicator (see below) | üü¢ Fresh |

### Freshness Status Guide

The **Status** column shows the batch freshness with color-coding:

#### üü¢ Fresh (Green Background)
- **Shelf life remaining:** 10+ days
- **Meaning:** Batch is in good condition
- **Action:** Normal operations, no special handling needed

#### üü° Aging (Yellow Background)
- **Shelf life remaining:** 5-9 days
- **Meaning:** Batch is aging and should be prioritized
- **Action:** Ship soon, prioritize for near-term demand

#### üî¥ Near Expiry (Red Background)
- **Shelf life remaining:** 0-4 days
- **Meaning:** Batch is approaching expiration
- **Action:** URGENT - Ship immediately or risk waste

#### ‚ö´ Expired (Dark Red Background)
- **Shelf life remaining:** < 0 days (negative)
- **Meaning:** Batch has already expired
- **Action:** Remove from inventory, record as waste

### Sorting and Filtering

Use the controls above the location list to find specific inventory:

**Sort by:**
- **Inventory Level (High to Low)** - Locations with most inventory first
- **Inventory Level (Low to High)** - Locations with least inventory first
- **Location ID** - Alphabetical by location ID
- **Location Name** - Alphabetical by location name

**Filter:**
- **Show All** - All locations in network
- **Only With Inventory** - Locations that have inventory > 0
- **Only Empty** - Locations with zero inventory

### Example Workflow: Finding Aging Inventory

**Goal:** Identify all batches with less than 7 days shelf life remaining

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Daily Inventory Snapshot
2. Select current date (or future date to plan ahead)
3. Expand each location with inventory
4. Look for yellow (üü° Aging) or red (üî¥ Near Expiry) rows
5. Note the batch IDs and quantities
6. Use batch traceability (see below) to investigate routing options

## Feature 2: Batch Traceability

### Accessing Batch Traceability

1. Scroll to the **Batch Traceability** section (below inventory, above demand satisfaction)
2. Click to expand **"üîç Trace Individual Batches"**
3. Select a batch from the dropdown menu

The dropdown shows: `Batch ID - Product (Production Date) - Quantity`

Example: `BATCH-2025-10-01-176283-001 - 176283 (2025-10-01) - 5,200 units`

### Understanding Batch Journey

Once you select a batch, you'll see four sections:

#### 1. Production Information

Shows when and where the batch was produced:
- **Production Date:** Manufacturing date
- **Manufactured at:** Location with human-readable name
- **Product:** Product ID
- **Quantity:** Total units produced in this batch
- **Initial State:** AMBIENT or FROZEN
- **Assigned Truck:** Truck schedule ID (if assigned)

#### 2. Shipment History

Lists all shipments for this batch:
- **Shipment ID:** Unique shipment identifier
- **Route:** Origin ‚Üí Destination (simplified)
- **Full Path:** Complete multi-leg route if applicable
- **Quantity:** Units shipped (may be partial batch)
- **Delivery Date:** When shipment arrived at destination
- **Transit Days:** Total days in transit
- **Transport Mode:** AMBIENT or FROZEN

**Note:** A single batch may have multiple shipments if split across routes.

#### 3. Current Locations

Shows where the batch currently resides (from model solution):
- **Location:** Location name and ID
- **Total Quantity:** Units at this location
- **State Breakdown:** Quantity by state (AMBIENT/FROZEN)

**If batch fully consumed:** Shows informational message

**If cohort inventory unavailable:** Shows message to run optimization with `use_batch_tracking=True`

#### 4. Timeline

Chronological list of all events for this batch:
- **Production** (Blue background)
- **Departure** (Yellow background)
- **Delivery** (Green background)

Each event shows:
- Date
- Event type
- Location
- Quantity
- Details

### Example Workflow: Investigating Delivery Delay

**Goal:** Understand why a batch hasn't arrived at destination yet

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Batch Traceability
2. Select the batch in question
3. Review **Shipment History** to see planned delivery date
4. Check **Current Locations** to see where batch actually is
5. Review **Timeline** to identify when batch departed and when it should arrive
6. Compare expected vs. actual location to diagnose delay

## Feature 3: Daily Snapshot Navigation

### Date Selection

**Slider:**
- Drag the slider to any date in the planning horizon
- Dates shown in format: YYYY-MM-DD (Day)
- Example: 2025-10-02 (Wed)

**Navigation Buttons:**
- **‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous Day:** Move back one day
- **Next Day ‚û°Ô∏è:** Move forward one day

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- Press button, then use keyboard to navigate

### Summary Metrics

At the top of each snapshot, you'll see:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Inventory** | Sum of all inventory across all locations |
| **In Transit** | Quantity currently being transported |
| **Production** | Total produced on this date |
| **Demand** | Total demand for this date |

Use these to quickly assess overall system state.
