"""
Diagnostic script to trace the truck loading timing bug.

The issue: Production is limited to 1.70M units instead of meeting 2.41M demand.

Critical flow to understand:
1. Production on date D flows into 6122_Storage inventory at date D
2. Trucks loading at departure_date access inventory from:
   - Morning trucks: 6122_Storage at (departure_date - 1)
   - Afternoon trucks: 6122_Storage at (departure_date - 1) + production at departure_date
3. truck_load variables are indexed by DELIVERY_DATE (not departure_date)
4. delivery_date = departure_date + transit_days

The constraint bug hypothesis:
- Morning trucks constraint (line 1595-1608) checks inventory at d_minus_1 where d_minus_1 = departure_date - 1
- But departure_date is DELIVERY_DATE in the current code (due to variable indexing)
- This means we're checking inventory TWO DAYS EARLY: (delivery_date - transit_days - 1)
- For a truck with 2-day transit, we check D-3 inventory when we should check D-1!

# Morning truck on Tuesday departing to 6125 (2-day transit, arrives Thursday):
#   - truck_load[truck, 6125, prod, Thursday] represents quantity
#   - Constraint: truck_load <= inventory[6122_Storage, prod, Monday]
#   - Inventory balance on Monday: inv[Mon] = production[Mon] - (trucks departing Mon)
#   - Inventory balance on Tuesday: inv[Tue] = inv[Mon] + production[Tue] - (trucks departing Tue)

# So truck departing Tuesday checks inventory at Monday.
# But inventory at Monday was CONSUMED by trucks departing Monday!
