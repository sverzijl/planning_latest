# Daily Snapshot FEFO Integration - Status & Limitation

**Commit:** 25293bf
**Status:** ‚úÖ FEFO auto-enabled, ‚ö†Ô∏è One limitation to address

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

**FEFO Auto-Enabled:**
- Runs automatically after each solve
- Creates 20+ batches with accurate production dates
- Ages calculated correctly (0-28 days, not all 0!)
- Batches tracked through network

**Daily Snapshot Integration:**
- Uses FEFO batches for inventory display
- Shows real batch IDs
- Production dates accurate
- Age calculations correct

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation

### **Issue: FEFO Shows Final State**

**What happens:**
1. FEFO processes ALL shipments through entire horizon (day 1-28)
2. Batches show FINAL locations (where they end up at day 28)
3. Daily Snapshot slider lets you pick day 1, 2, 3, etc.
4. But batches for day 3 show locations at day 28 (wrong!)

**Example:**
```
Batch produced Oct 28
- Day 1 (Oct 28): At 6122 (manufacturing) ‚úÖ
- Day 2 (Oct 29): Ships to 6104 ‚Üê Should show here
- Day 3 (Oct 30): Still at 6104 ‚Üê Should show here

BUT: FEFO processes ALL shipments, so batch shows:
  location_id = 6130 (final destination at day 28)

When viewing snapshot for Day 2, incorrectly shows batch at 6130!
```

**Result:**
- Production dates: ‚úÖ Correct
- Ages: ‚úÖ Correct
- Locations: ‚ùå Shows final location, not intermediate

---

## üîß Solutions

### **Option A: Date-Filtered FEFO** (30 minutes)

Run FEFO up to snapshot date only:

```python
def _extract_inventory_from_model(self, location_id, snapshot_date):
    # Run FEFO only up to snapshot_date
    fefo_detail = self._run_fefo_up_to_date(snapshot_date)
    # Use batches at their locations on snapshot_date
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate locations for each date
- ‚úÖ Correct inventory at intermediate dates
- ‚úÖ Proper batch tracking over time

**Cost:**
- Slower (run FEFO per snapshot request)
- More complex

### **Option B: FEFO History Tracking** (1 hour)

Enhance FEFO to track batch locations by date:

```python
class Batch:
    location_history: Dict[Date, str]  # date ‚Üí location_id
    quantity_history: Dict[Date, float]  # date ‚Üí quantity
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ One FEFO run captures all dates
- ‚úÖ Fast lookups for any snapshot date
- ‚úÖ Complete history available

**Cost:**
- More memory
- More complex FEFO logic

### **Option C: Keep Current (Simplest)**

Accept that Daily Snapshot shows:
- ‚úÖ Accurate production dates
- ‚úÖ Accurate ages
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Final locations (not intermediate)

**When acceptable:**
- If you mainly care about FINAL state
- If age tracking is more important than location
- If you rarely use intermediate date snapshots

---

## üéØ My Recommendation

**For Now:** Test Option C (current implementation)

**Check:**
1. Are production dates correct now? (not all snapshot_date)
2. Are ages correct now? (not all 0 days)
3. Do you frequently use the date slider for intermediate dates?

**If intermediate dates critical:** I'll implement Option A (30 min fix)

**If current is good enough:** Keep as-is and enjoy the speed!

## üìä What You'll See After Pull

**Daily Snapshot:**
```
Date: Oct 31 (day 4)

Location: 6104 (Hub)
  Batch: batch_..._2025-10-28_abc
    Product: HELGAS WHOLEM
    Production Date: Oct 28 ‚úÖ (accurate!)
    Age: 3 days ‚úÖ (accurate!)
    Quantity: 1,500 units
    Location: Shows final destination ‚ö†Ô∏è (might not be at 6104 on day 4)

Location: 6122 (Manufacturing)
  Batch: batch_..._2025-10-31_xyz
    Production Date: Oct 31 ‚úÖ
    Age: 0 days ‚úÖ
    Quantity: 2,000 units
```

**Better than before (age=0, prod_date=snapshot_date) but not perfect for intermediate dates.**

---

## üîÑ Test and Decide

**Pull:**
```bash
git pull
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**Test Daily Snapshot:**
1. Run a solve
2. Go to Daily Snapshot tab
3. Use date slider to view different dates
4. Check:
   - Production dates (should vary, not all same)
   - Ages (should vary, not all 0)
   - Locations (might show final, not intermediate)

**Then tell me:**
- Are production dates correct now? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Are ages correct now? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Do you need accurate locations for intermediate dates? Yes/No

If you need perfect intermediate snapshots, I'll implement Option A!

**Pull and test - production dates and ages should be much better now!** üöÄ
