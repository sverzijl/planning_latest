BOTTLENECK HYPOTHESIS TEST
======================================================================

Hypothesis:
  Week 2 capacity bottleneck (demand > capacity) causes the cliff
  by creating temporal symmetry in production timing decisions.

Prediction:
  - WITH bottleneck (original demand):    >60s or timeout
  - WITHOUT bottleneck (reduced demand):  <5s (fast)
