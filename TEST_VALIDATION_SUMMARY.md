# Test Validation Summary
## Non-Fixed Day Fix Validation Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Fix Location:** `src/optimization/unified_node_model.py` lines 343-346
**Fix Type:** CRITICAL - Resolves model infeasibility on non-fixed days

---

## Executive Summary

### The Problem
Prior to this fix, the UnifiedNodeModel was **INFEASIBLE** when production was required on non-fixed days (weekends/holidays). The root cause was in the Big-M constraint calculation for product production capacity.

### The Fix
```python
# BEFORE (lines 343-346):
else:
    # Non-fixed day
    day_hours = labor_day.fixed_hours  # This was 0 for weekends/holidays!

# AFTER (lines 343-346):
else:
    # Non-fixed day: unlimited capacity at premium rate
    # Use 24 hours as reasonable physical upper bound for Big-M
    day_hours = 24.0  # FIX: Was labor_day.fixed_hours (which is 0)
```

### Impact
The fix changes the Big-M calculation from:
- **Before:** `M = 0 * 1400 = 0` → Production forced to 0 → INFEASIBLE
- **After:** `M = 24.0 * 1400 = 33,600` → Production allowed → FEASIBLE

This enables:
- Weekend production with 4-hour minimum payment
- Public holiday production with premium rates
- Multi-day planning scenarios with non-fixed days
- Accurate labor cost modeling across all day types

## Validation Structure

### Phase 1: Non-Fixed Day Unit Tests (CRITICAL)
**Purpose:** Verify previously failing tests now pass

| Test ID | Test Name | Status Before | Expected After |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Test 1 | Weekend Production Below Minimum | INFEASIBLE | PASS (2.75h used, 4h paid) |
| Test 2 | Public Holiday Overhead Above Min | INFEASIBLE | PASS (4.25h, overhead verified) |
| Test 3 | Public Holiday Overhead Below Min | INFEASIBLE | PASS (1.75h used, 4h paid) |

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Quick validation (all 3 tests):
./run_phase1_only.py

# Individual tests:
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_cost_piecewise.py::test_piecewise_non_fixed_day_below_minimum -v -s
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_overhead_holiday.py::test_public_holiday_overhead_included -v -s
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_overhead_holiday.py::test_public_holiday_overhead_below_minimum -v -s
```

**Expected Results:**
- **Test 1:** Weekend production of 2,800 units (2h) with 4h minimum payment ($160)
- **Test 2:** Holiday production of 4,200 units (3h) with overhead included
- **Test 3:** Holiday production of 1,400 units (1h) with 4h minimum enforced

---

### Phase 2: Regression Test Suite
**Purpose:** Ensure no existing functionality broken

| Suite ID | Test Suite | Test Count | Expected Status |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Suite 1 | Weekday Labor Costs | 4 tests | 3 PASS, 1 SKIP |
| Suite 2 | Multi-Day Consistency | 2 tests | 2 PASS |
| Suite 3 | Overtime Preference | Multiple | All PASS |
| Suite 4 | Baseline Labor Costs | Multiple | All PASS |
| Suite 5 | Labor Cost Isolation | Multiple | All PASS |
| Suite 6 | Unified Model Core | 7 tests | All PASS |

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# All suites:
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_cost_piecewise.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_overhead_multi_day.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_overtime_preference.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_cost_baseline.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_cost_isolation.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_unified_node_model.py -v
```

**Critical Checks:**
- No new failures in existing tests
- Solve times remain < 30 seconds

## Technical Details

### Big-M Constraint Impact

**Constraint:**
```python
# For each node-product-date:
production[n, p, d] <= production_rate[n, p] * max_labor_hours * production_day[n, d]
```

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Non-fixed day (weekend/holiday):
max_labor_hours = labor_day.fixed_hours = 0.0
M = 1400 * 0.0 = 0
production[n, p, d] <= 0 * production_day[n, d] = 0  # Forces production to 0!
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# Non-fixed day:
max_labor_hours = 24.0  # Physical upper bound
M = 1400 * 24.0 = 33,600
production[n, p, d] <= 33,600 * production_day[n, d]  # Allows up to 33,600 units
```

### Why 24.0 Hours?

1. **Physical constraint:** Can't produce more than 24 hours in a day
2. **Big enough:** Allows maximum theoretical capacity (33,600 units > practical limits)
3. **Reasonable:** Doesn't cause numerical issues in solver
4. **Conservative:** Actual capacity limited by labor cost optimization (model won't use all 24h due to cost)

---

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Fix Applied
```bash
grep -A 3 "day_hours = 24.0" src/optimization/unified_node_model.py
```

Expected output:
```python
day_hours = 24.0  # FIX: Was labor_day.fixed_hours (which is 0)

max_labor_hours = max(max_labor_hours, day_hours)
```

### Step 2: Run Phase 1 (Critical Tests)
```bash
./run_phase1_only.py
```

**MUST SEE:**
- All 3 tests PASS
- Solve time < 5 seconds per test
- Labor hours with overhead
- 4h minimum enforced where applicable

### Step 3: Run Phase 2 (Regression Tests)
```bash
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_cost_piecewise.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_labor_overhead_multi_day.py -v
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_unified_node_model.py -v
```

**MUST SEE:**
- No new failures
- No increased solve times
- Consistent behavior with weekday tests

### Step 4: Run Integration Test
```bash
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py -v
```

**MUST SEE:**
- PASS status
- < 30 seconds solve time
- ≥ 85% fill rate

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Expected to Pass)
- Phase 1 tests (fix directly addresses root cause)
- Integration test (uses real scenario, fix enables feasibility)

### Medium Risk (Regression Potential)
- Phase 2 Suite 1 (weekday labor tests - shares constraints)
- Phase 2 Suite 2 (multi-day tests - affected by fix)

### Minimal Risk (Independent)
- Phase 2 Suites 3-5 (not directly affected by Big-M change)
- Phase 2 Suite 6 (core model tests - stable)

---

## Next Actions

### If All Tests Pass
1. ✅ Commit fix with detailed message
2. ✅ Update documentation (CLAUDE.md - already done)
3. ✅ Update technical spec (UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md)
4. ✅ Run full test suite: `pytest tests/ -v`
5. ✅ Close related issues/tickets

### If Tests Fail
1. ❌ Document failures in validation report
2. ❌ Analyze failure patterns (all tests? specific scenarios?)
3. ❌ Check solver logs for constraint violations
4. ❌ Investigate alternative Big-M formulations
5. ❌ Consider constraint restructuring

---

## Contact/Support

If issues arise during validation:
1. Check solver availability: `venv/bin/python -c "from pyomo.environ import SolverFactory; print(SolverFactory('cbc').available())"`
2. Review solver output with `-s` flag for detailed logs
3. Check constraint formulation in `unified_node_model.py` lines 500-650
4. Verify labor calendar data structure in test setup functions

---

## Conclusion

This validation plan provides comprehensive coverage of the non-fixed day fix:
- **Phase 1** confirms the fix resolves the root cause (3 critical tests)
- **Phase 2** ensures no regressions (6 test suites)
- **Phase 3** validates real-world applicability (integration test)

**Expected Outcome:** All 10 test groups PASS, demonstrating the fix enables weekend/holiday production without breaking existing functionality.

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes for full validation

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Fix directly addresses root cause with minimal risk of side effects
