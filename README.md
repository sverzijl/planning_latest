![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)

An integrated production scheduling and distribution optimization application for gluten-free bread, from manufacturing through multi-echelon frozen and ambient transport networks to breadrooms.

## Overview

This application optimizes end-to-end operations for perishable gluten-free bread by:
- **Production scheduling:** Determining optimal daily production quantities and timing
- **Labor optimization:** Managing fixed hours, overtime, and non-fixed labor days to minimize costs
- **Truck loading:** Assigning production batches to morning and afternoon trucks
- **Route planning:** Modeling multi-step distribution routes (frozen/ambient)
- **Shelf life management:** Tracking state transitions (thawing resets from 120 days to 14 days)
- **Cost minimization:** Minimizing total cost to serve (labor + transport + storage + waste)

## Key Features

### Current (Phase 1 - MVP)
- üìä Excel data upload (.xlsm format: forecast, locations, routes, labor, trucks, costs)
- üèóÔ∏è Network modeling with graph structures
- üè≠ Production and manufacturing site modeling
- üì¶ Location and route management
- üöö Truck schedule management (morning/afternoon departures)
- üíº Labor calendar with cost structure
- üå°Ô∏è Shelf life tracking (ambient: 17 days, frozen: 120 days, thawed: 14 days)

### Planned
- **Phase 2:** Production feasibility, labor cost calculation, truck loading logic, shelf life engine, route visualization
- **Phase 3:** Integrated production-distribution optimization with cost minimization and solver integration
- **Phase 4:** Flexible truck routing, multi-period planning, stochastic scenarios, production smoothing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd planning_latest
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit web interface:
```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Quick Start: Two-File Workflow

The recommended workflow uses separate files for forecast and network configuration:

```python
from src.parsers import MultiFileParser

# Load forecast and network configuration
parser = MultiFileParser(
    forecast_file="data/examples/your_forecast.xlsx",  # Your forecast file
    network_file="data/examples/Network_Config.xlsx"   # Provided template
)

# Parse all data
forecast, locations, routes, labor, trucks, costs = parser.parse_all()

# Validate consistency
validation = parser.validate_consistency(forecast, locations, routes)
print(f"Loaded {len(forecast.entries)} forecast entries for {len(locations)} locations")
```

Alternatively, upload both files through the Streamlit UI (Upload Data page).

### SAP IBP Forecast Conversion

If your forecast data is in **SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP)** export format (wide format with dates as columns), you can convert it to the required long format:

**Option 1: Streamlit UI (Automatic Detection)**
1. Upload your SAP IBP file to the Upload Data page
2. The application automatically detects SAP IBP format
3. Click "üîÑ Convert SAP IBP to Long Format" button
4. Preview converted data and download the result

**Option 2: Command-Line Tool**
```bash
# Convert with default output name (input_file_Converted.xlsx)
python scripts/convert_sap_ibp.py "data/Gfree Forecast.xlsm"

# Convert with custom output name
python scripts/convert_sap_ibp.py "Gfree Forecast.xlsm" "Forecast_Long.xlsx"

# Verbose mode with detailed output
python scripts/convert_sap_ibp.py "Gfree Forecast.xlsm" -v
```

**Option 3: Python API**
```python
from src.parsers import SapIbpConverter

# Convert SAP IBP file
converter = SapIbpConverter("data/Gfree Forecast.xlsm")
df_forecast = converter.convert()

# Save to Excel
converter.convert_and_save("Forecast_Converted.xlsx")

# Result: 9,180 entries (9 locations √ó 5 products √ó 204 days)
```

See `data/examples/SAP_IBP_FORMAT.md` for details on SAP IBP format structure.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run labor validation integration tests
pytest tests/test_labor_validation_integration.py -v

# Run labor calendar validation tests
pytest tests/test_integrated_model.py::TestLaborCalendarValidation -v

# Run with verbose output and stop on first 5 failures
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --maxfail=5

# Run tests with detailed coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
# Then open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

**Test Coverage:** 661 tests covering all core models, parsers, multi-file workflow, SAP IBP conversion, labor validation, and integrated optimization

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Integration Test (Required for Model Changes)

**Before committing ANY changes to optimization model or solver code, you MUST run the integration test:**

```bash
# Required validation gate for optimization changes
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py -v
```

This test validates the complete UI workflow with real production data and ensures:
- ‚úì Solve time < 30 seconds (4-week horizon with 17,760 forecast entries)
- ‚úì Solution quality: 95%+ demand satisfaction, optimal status
- ‚úì UI compatibility: Matches Planning Tab settings exactly
- ‚úì No performance regressions or infeasibilities

**The test MUST pass before committing changes to:**
- `src/optimization/` (model formulation, constraints, objective)
- Solver parameters or performance optimizations
- Constraint logic or decision variables
- Route enumeration or batch tracking code

See `tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py` for detailed documentation and `CLAUDE.md` for complete testing requirements.

### Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Tests Workflow:** Runs all tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12
- **Coverage Workflow:** Generates coverage reports and uploads to Codecov
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Optional local testing before commits

To enable pre-commit hooks:
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install git hooks
pre-commit install

# Manually run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/ ui/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/ ui/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ui'

**Problem:** When running the Streamlit app, you get:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ui'
Traceback:
File ".../ui/app.py", line X, in <module>
    from ui import session_state
```

**Root Cause:** The application uses absolute imports (`from ui import ...`) which require the project root directory to be in Python's path. This error occurs when:
1. Running from the wrong directory
2. Python path doesn't include the project root
3. Working directory is not set correctly

**Solution 1: Run from Correct Directory (Recommended)**

Always run Streamlit from the **project root directory** (`planning_latest/`):

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd planning_latest

# Run Streamlit (NOT from ui/ directory!)
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**Solution 2: Check Working Directory**

Verify you're in the correct directory:
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
pwd
# Should show: .../planning_latest

# On Windows
cd
# Should show: ...\planning_latest
```

If you're in the wrong directory (e.g., `planning_latest/ui/`), navigate up one level:
```bash
cd ..
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**Solution 3: Windows WinPython Users**

If using WinPython portable distribution:
1. Open WinPython Command Prompt (not regular Command Prompt)
2. Navigate to project root: `cd C:\path\to\planning_latest`
3. Activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Run: `streamlit run ui/app.py`

**Solution 4: Verify Python Path Setup**

The application automatically adds the project root to `sys.path`. If you still see errors:
1. Check the path in error message - look for duplicate directories (e.g., `planning_latest\planning_latest`)
2. Ensure project isn't nested incorrectly
3. Try: `python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"` to debug

**Note:** The application includes automatic path setup in all UI files (added in v2.1), so this error should be resolved. If it persists, please report the issue with your environment details.

### Other Common Issues

**Streamlit Not Found:**

**Excel File Read Errors:**
```bash
# Install openpyxl for .xlsx/.xlsm files
pip install openpyxl

### Shelf Life
- **Ambient storage:** 17 days
- **Frozen storage:** 120 days
- **Thawed product:** 14 days (reset after thawing)
- **Breadroom policy:** Discards stock with <7 days remaining

### Distribution Network

**Topology:** 2-Echelon Hub-and-Spoke + Frozen Buffer

**Manufacturing Site:** Location ID 6122

**Regional Hubs (with dual role as local breadrooms):**
- **6104 (Moorebank, NSW):** Hub + local breadroom serving NSW & ACT region
  - Forwards to: 6105 (Rydalmere), 6103 (Canberra)
  - Hub region demand: 849,841 units (6104: 432,595 + spoke locations: 417,246)
