  Adding core constraints...
  Changeover tracking constraints added (448 constraints)
  Big-M: Using max_mixes per product (tighter than max_production)
  Labor cost constraints added (28 node-date pairs, 252 constraints)
  Adding storage shipment delay constraint for 3 nodes: ['6104', '6125', 'Lineage']
    Added 75 storage delay constraints
  Hybrid pallet formulation (MIP optimization):
    Small cohorts (integer 0-10): 2,030
    Domain reduced: 62 â†’ 10 (84% reduction)
  Pallet tracking enabled for states: ['frozen']
    - Pallet integer variables: 2,030
    - Domain per variable: 0-10 (vs 0-62 full formulation)
    - Unit-tracked states: ['ambient', 'thawed']
  Holding cost enabled: 17,780 total cohorts (5,926 pallet-tracked)

  Staleness penalty enabled: $5.0000 per unit per age ratio
  Staleness penalty calculation: 14,175 demand cohorts
  Formula: (age_days / 17) Ã— $5.0000 Ã— demand_satisfied
  Changeover cost enabled: $38.40 per start
  Core constraints added
  Truck constraints added (generalized for any node)
  Model complete and ready to solve
