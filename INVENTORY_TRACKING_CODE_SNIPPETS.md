# Inventory Tracking Code Snippets

This document provides key code snippets from the Pyomo model showing how inventory is tracked at all locations.

## 1. Inventory Location Set Creation

**File:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`
**Lines:** 197-223

```python
# Set of destination locations (from forecast)
self.destinations: Set[str] = {e.location_id for e in self.forecast.entries}

# STATE TRACKING: Location storage mode categorization
# Create location lookup dictionary
self.location_by_id: Dict[str, Location] = {loc.id: loc for loc in self.locations}

# Categorize locations by storage capability
self.locations_frozen_storage: Set[str] = {
    loc.id for loc in self.locations
    if loc.storage_mode in [StorageMode.FROZEN, StorageMode.BOTH]
}
self.locations_ambient_storage: Set[str] = {
    loc.id for loc in self.locations
    if loc.storage_mode in [StorageMode.AMBIENT, StorageMode.BOTH]
} | {'6122_Storage'}  # Virtual storage at manufacturing site

# Identify intermediate storage locations (storage type, no demand)
self.intermediate_storage: Set[str] = {
    loc.id for loc in self.locations
    if loc.type == LocationType.STORAGE and loc.id not in self.destinations
}

# All locations that need inventory tracking (destinations + intermediate + 6122_Storage)
# 6122_Storage is a virtual location that receives production from 6122 and supplies trucks
self.inventory_locations: Set[str] = self.destinations | self.intermediate_storage | {'6122_Storage'}
```

**Key Points:**
- `destinations` = All locations with demand in forecast (9 breadrooms)
- `intermediate_storage` = Storage locations without demand (1 location: Lineage)
- `inventory_locations` = destinations ∪ intermediate_storage ∪ {6122_Storage} (11 total)
- Model tracks inventory at ALL 11 locations

## 2. Sparse Index Set Creation

**File:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`
**Lines:** 909-937

```python
self.inventory_frozen_index_set = set()
self.inventory_ambient_index_set = set()

for loc in self.inventory_locations:
    # Special handling for virtual location 6122_Storage
    if loc == '6122_Storage':
        # 6122_Storage only supports ambient storage (virtual manufacturing storage)
        for prod in self.products:
            for date in sorted_dates:
                self.inventory_ambient_index_set.add((loc, prod, date))
        continue  # Skip to next location

    # Regular locations: look up in location_by_id
    loc_obj = self.location_by_id.get(loc)
    if not loc_obj:
        continue

    for prod in self.products:
        for date in sorted_dates:
            # Add frozen inventory if location supports frozen storage
            if loc in self.locations_frozen_storage:
                self.inventory_frozen_index_set.add((loc, prod, date))

            # Add ambient inventory if location supports ambient storage
            if loc in self.locations_ambient_storage:
                self.inventory_ambient_index_set.add((loc, prod, date))

model.inventory_frozen_index = list(self.inventory_frozen_index_set)
model.inventory_ambient_index = list(self.inventory_ambient_index_set)
```

**Key Points:**
- Sparse indexing: Only create variables for valid (location, storage_mode) combinations
- `inventory_frozen_index_set`: Locations supporting frozen storage (Lineage, 6120, 6130)
- `inventory_ambient_index_set`: Locations supporting ambient storage (all 9 breadrooms + 6122_Storage)
- Virtual location 6122_Storage only gets ambient inventory

## 3. Inventory Variable Definitions

**File:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`
**Lines:** 1047-1062

```python
# STATE TRACKING: Decision variables for frozen and ambient inventory
# inventory_frozen[loc, product, date]: Frozen inventory at location (no shelf life decay)
# inventory_ambient[loc, product, date]: Ambient inventory at location (subject to shelf life)
# Represents inventory level at location at END of each date
# After shipments arrive and demand is satisfied
model.inventory_frozen = Var(
    model.inventory_frozen_index,
    within=NonNegativeReals,
    doc="Frozen inventory at location by product and date (no shelf life decay)"
)

model.inventory_ambient = Var(
    model.inventory_ambient_index,
    within=NonNegativeReals,
    doc="Ambient/thawed inventory at location by product and date (subject to shelf life)"
)
```

**Key Points:**
- Two separate inventory variables: frozen and ambient
- Indexed by sparse index sets (only valid combinations)
- NonNegativeReals domain (can have fractional units)
- Represents end-of-day inventory after all flows

## 4. Frozen Inventory Balance Constraint

**File:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`
**Lines:** 1271-1343

```python
def inventory_frozen_balance_rule(model, loc, prod, date):
    """
    Frozen inventory balance at location.

    frozen_inv[t] = frozen_inv[t-1] + frozen_arrivals[t] - frozen_outflows[t]

    Frozen inventory:
    - Increases from frozen route arrivals (frozen route + frozen-only destination)
    - Decreases from outbound shipments on frozen routes (for intermediate storage)
    - Does NOT satisfy demand directly (must thaw first)
    - No shelf life decay (120-day limit is generous)

    Args:
        loc: Location ID (destination or intermediate storage)
        prod: Product ID
        date: Date (end of day)
    """
    # LEG-BASED ROUTING: Get legs delivering frozen to this location
    legs_frozen_arrival = [
        (o, d) for (o, d) in self.legs_to_location.get(loc, [])
        if self.leg_arrival_state.get((o, d)) == 'frozen'
    ]

    # Frozen arrivals
    frozen_arrivals = sum(
        model.shipment_leg[(o, d), prod, date]
        for (o, d) in legs_frozen_arrival
    )

    # LEG-BASED ROUTING: Frozen outflows (shipments departing from this location)
    # Only relevant for intermediate storage like Lineage
    frozen_outflows = 0
    if loc in self.intermediate_storage:
        # Find legs originating from this location
        legs_from_loc = self.legs_from_location.get(loc, [])

        # Sum outbound shipments departing on this date
        for (origin, dest) in legs_from_loc:
            # Shipment variable is indexed by delivery_date
            # To find shipments departing on 'date', we need delivery_date where:
            # departure_date = delivery_date - transit_days = date
            # Therefore: delivery_date = date + transit_days
            transit_days = self.leg_transit_days[(origin, dest)]
            delivery_date = date + timedelta(days=transit_days)
            if delivery_date in model.dates:
                frozen_outflows += model.shipment_leg[(origin, dest), prod, delivery_date]

    # Previous frozen inventory
    prev_date = self.date_previous.get(date)
    if prev_date is None:
        # First date: use initial inventory if provided, otherwise 0
        # Note: initial_inventory can be Dict[(loc, prod), qty] or Dict[(loc, prod, state), qty]
        # Try state-specific first, then fallback to non-state
        prev_frozen = self.initial_inventory.get((loc, prod, 'frozen'),
                      self.initial_inventory.get((loc, prod), 0))
    else:
        # Check if previous date inventory exists in sparse index
        if (loc, prod, prev_date) in self.inventory_frozen_index_set:
            prev_frozen = model.inventory_frozen[loc, prod, prev_date]
        else:
            prev_frozen = 0

    # Balance equation
    return model.inventory_frozen[loc, prod, date] == (
        prev_frozen + frozen_arrivals - frozen_outflows
    )

model.inventory_frozen_balance_con = Constraint(
    model.inventory_frozen_index,
    rule=inventory_frozen_balance_rule,
    doc="Frozen inventory balance at locations (no shelf life decay)"
)
```

**Key Points:**
- Balance: `inventory[t] = inventory[t-1] + arrivals - outflows`
- Frozen arrivals from incoming frozen route legs
- Frozen outflows only for intermediate storage (Lineage → 6130)
- No demand satisfaction from frozen inventory (must thaw first)
- Applies to 3 locations: Lineage, 6120, 6130

## 5. Ambient Inventory Balance Constraint

**File:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/integrated_model.py`
**Lines:** 1346-1475

```python
def inventory_ambient_balance_rule(model, loc, prod, date):
    """
    Ambient inventory balance at location.

    ambient_inv[t] = ambient_inv[t-1] + ambient_arrivals[t] - demand[t] + shortage[t]

    Note: shortage represents UNSATISFIED demand. Actual consumption = demand - shortage.
    Therefore: inventory = prev + arrivals - (demand - shortage) - outflows
                         = prev + arrivals - demand + shortage - outflows

    Special case for 6122_Storage (virtual manufacturing storage):
    - Arrivals = production on that date
    - Departures = truck loads departing on that date
    - No demand or shortage

    Ambient inventory:
    - Increases from ambient route arrivals (includes automatic thawing from frozen routes)
    - Decreases from demand satisfaction (only at demand locations)
    - Subject to shelf life constraints (17 days ambient, 14 days post-thaw)

    Args:
        loc: Location ID (destination or intermediate storage)
        prod: Product ID
        date: Date (end of day)

    # This includes:
    # - True ambient legs
    # - Frozen legs that thaw on arrival (frozen leg to non-frozen destination)

        (o, d) for (o, d) in self.legs_to_location.get(loc, [])

            prev_ambient = model.inventory_ambient[loc, prod, prev_date]
        else:
            prev_ambient = 0

    # Balance equation
    # Correct formulation: shortage represents UNSATISFIED demand
    # Actual consumption from inventory = demand - shortage
    # Therefore: inventory[t] = prev + arrivals - (demand - shortage) - outflows
    #                          = prev + arrivals - demand + shortage - outflows

model.inventory_ambient_balance_con = Constraint(
    model.inventory_ambient_index,
    rule=inventory_ambient_balance_rule,
    doc="Ambient inventory balance at locations (subject to shelf life)"
)
```

**Key Points:**

### For 6122_Storage (Virtual Manufacturing Storage):
- Balance: `inventory = previous + production - truck_loads`
- No demand or shortage
- Links production variables to truck loading

### For Standard Locations (9 breadrooms):
- Balance: `inventory = previous + arrivals - demand + shortage - outflows`
- Arrivals include automatic thawing from frozen routes
- Demand satisfaction reduces inventory
- Shortage (if allowed) represents unsatisfied demand
- Outflows occur at hub locations (6104, 6125) shipping to spokes

### Hub Locations (6104, 6125):
- **Inflows:** Shipments from manufacturing (6122)
- **Outflows:** Shipments to spoke breadrooms
- **Demand:** Hub's own consumption
- All three components tracked in single balance equation

## 6. Hub Location Example: 6104 (NSW/ACT Hub)

Location 6104 serves dual purpose:
1. **Hub:** Receives from 6122, redistributes to spoke locations
2. **Breadroom:** Has its own demand

**Inventory tracking at 6104:**

```python
# For location 6104 on date D:
inventory_ambient[6104, prod, D] ==
    inventory_ambient[6104, prod, D-1]              # Previous inventory
    + sum(shipments arriving from 6122 on D)        # Inflows from manufacturing
    - demand[6104, prod, D]                         # Hub's own consumption
    + shortage[6104, prod, D]                       # Unsatisfied demand (if any)
    - sum(shipments departing to spokes on D)       # Outflows to breadrooms
```

**Verification:** Model correctly tracks all three components

## 7. Thawing Location Example: 6130 (WA Thawing)

Location 6130 has special thawing behavior:
- Receives frozen shipments (via Lineage → 6130 frozen route)
- Automatic thawing on arrival (shelf life resets to 14 days)
- Has both frozen and ambient inventory variables

**Frozen inventory at 6130:**
```python
# Receives frozen product from Lineage
inventory_frozen[6130, prod, D] ==
    inventory_frozen[6130, prod, D-1]               # Previous frozen inventory
    + shipment_leg[Lineage→6130, prod, D]           # Frozen arrivals from Lineage
    - 0                                             # No frozen outflows (terminal location)
```

**Ambient inventory at 6130:**
```python
# Automatic thawing happens via route leg arrival state
# Frozen routes to 6130 have leg_arrival_state = 'ambient' (automatic thaw)
inventory_ambient[6130, prod, D] ==
    inventory_ambient[6130, prod, D-1]              # Previous ambient inventory
    + sum(thawed shipments arriving on D)           # Arrivals (frozen→thawed)
    - demand[6130, prod, D]                         # Demand satisfaction
    + shortage[6130, prod, D]                       # Unsatisfied demand (if any)
    - 0                                             # No ambient outflows
```

**Verification:** Model correctly tracks both frozen receipt and automatic thawing

## Summary

The Pyomo model correctly tracks inventory at ALL 11 locations:

1. **9 Breadroom Destinations** (ambient inventory)
   - 6103, 6104, 6105, 6110, 6120, 6123, 6125, 6130, 6134

2. **1 Intermediate Storage** (frozen inventory)
   - Lineage

3. **1 Virtual Manufacturing Storage** (ambient inventory)
   - 6122_Storage

**Total Variables:**
- Frozen inventory: 3 locations × products × dates
- Ambient inventory: 10 locations × products × dates

**Total Constraints:**
- Frozen balance: 3 locations × products × dates
- Ambient balance: 10 locations × products × dates

**Model Coverage: 100% of relevant locations**
