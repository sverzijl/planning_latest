# Daily Snapshot Component - Quick Start

## TL;DR

```python
from ui.components import render_daily_snapshot

# Get your results and locations
results = get_current_results()  # Dict with 'production_schedule' and 'shipments'
locations_list = st.session_state.get('locations', [])
locations = {loc.location_id: loc for loc in locations_list} if locations_list else {}

# Render the component
render_daily_snapshot(results, locations)
```

## What You Get

üì∏ Interactive daily inventory snapshot with:
- Date selector (slider + prev/next buttons)
- Summary metrics (inventory, in-transit, production, demand)
- Location inventory (expandable, color-coded by age)
- In-transit shipments
- Manufacturing activity
- Inflows and outflows
- Demand satisfaction tracking

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ui/components/daily_snapshot.py` | Main component (import from here) |
| `test_daily_snapshot_ui.py` | Demo app with mock data |
| `DAILY_SNAPSHOT_USAGE.md` | Comprehensive guide |

## Test It

```bash
streamlit run test_daily_snapshot_ui.py
```

## Add to Results Page

**Location**: `ui/pages/3_Results.py`

**Step 1**: Add import at top
```python
from ui.components import render_daily_snapshot
```

**Step 2**: Add tab
```python
tab_overview, tab_production, tab_distribution, tab_costs, tab_comparison, tab_snapshot = st.tabs([
    "üìä Overview", "üì¶ Production", "üöö Distribution", "üí∞ Costs", "‚öñÔ∏è Comparison",
    "üì∏ Daily Snapshot"  # ADD THIS
])
```

**Step 3**: Add tab content at bottom of file
```python
with tab_snapshot:
    st.markdown("""
    <div class="info-box">
        <div style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 8px;">üì∏ Daily Snapshot</div>
        <div>Interactive daily view of inventory, production, shipments, and demand.</div>
    </div>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)

    st.divider()

    results = get_current_results()
    locations_list = st.session_state.get('locations', [])
    locations = {loc.location_id: loc for loc in locations_list} if locations_list else {}

    render_daily_snapshot(results, locations, key_prefix="results_snapshot")
```

Done! üéâ

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Summary Metrics
Four colored cards at top showing daily totals.

### 2. Location Inventory
Expandable sections for each location with batch details.
- üü¢ Green: Fresh (0-3 days)
- üü° Yellow: Medium (4-7 days)
- üî¥ Red: Old (8+ days)

### 3. In-Transit
Shows shipments currently traveling between locations.

### 4. Manufacturing
Production batches created on selected date.

### 5. Inflows
- Production events (blue)
- Arrivals (green)

### 6. Outflows
- Departures (yellow)
- Demand fulfillment (light blue)

### 7. Demand Satisfaction
Shows if all demand is met or if there are shortages.

## API

```python
render_daily_snapshot(
    results: Dict[str, Any],      # Must have 'production_schedule' and 'shipments'
    locations: Dict[str, Location], # location_id -> Location mapping
    key_prefix: str = "daily_snapshot"  # For multiple instances
)
```

## Data Requirements

**results** must contain:
- `production_schedule`: ProductionSchedule object
- `shipments`: List[Shipment]

**locations** dict should map:
- `location_id` ‚Üí `Location` object (with `name` attribute)

**Optional** in session state:
- `forecast`: Forecast object (for demand data)

## Customization

Use different `key_prefix` for multiple instances:

```python
render_daily_snapshot(results, locations, key_prefix="snapshot_1")
render_daily_snapshot(results, locations, key_prefix="snapshot_2")
```

## Color Codes

| Element | Color | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Batch age 0-3d | Green | Fresh |
| Batch age 4-7d | Yellow | Medium |
| Batch age 8+d | Red | Old |
| Production inflow | Blue | Manufactured |
| Arrival inflow | Green | Received |
| Departure outflow | Yellow | Shipped |
| Demand outflow | Light blue | Consumed |
| Demand met | Green | Satisfied |
| Demand short | Yellow | Shortage |

## Troubleshooting

**No data shown?**
- Check `production_schedule.production_batches` is not empty
- Check `shipments` list is not empty
- Verify dates are valid date objects

**Demand section empty?**
- Add forecast to session state: `st.session_state['forecast'] = forecast_object`

**Only manufacturing site has inventory?**
- Expected! Simplified tracker only shows production location.
- Full network tracking requires additional implementation.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test with mock data: `streamlit run test_daily_snapshot_ui.py`
2. ‚úÖ Read usage guide: `DAILY_SNAPSHOT_USAGE.md`
3. ‚úÖ Integrate into Results page (steps above)
4. ‚úÖ Gather user feedback
5. ‚è≥ Enhance with additional features as needed
