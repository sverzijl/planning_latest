    The Weekly Solve workflow will provide:

        - Demand delta heatmap (forecast changes)
        - Cost comparison (old vs new)
        - Constraint violation detection
        - Solve age indicator

        ### Workflow Steps
        1. Upload updated forecast
        2. Review current inventory
        3. Preview and approve warmstart
        4. Configure solve
        5. Run optimization

        ### Performance
        - Faster solves with warmstart (typically 30-50% reduction)
        - Maintains solution quality
        - Handles forecast changes gracefully
