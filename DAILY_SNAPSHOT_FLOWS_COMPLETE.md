## ðŸŽŠ All Flows Now Visible

Your request: *"I don't see manufactured goods flowing, units being consumed by demand, nor shipped"*

**Delivered:** âœ… **All flows now tracked and displayed!**

  - Batch batch_6122_WONDER_WHITE_2025-10-29: 1,245 units produced
  Total: 5 batches, 6,225 units manufactured
```

### **2. Inflows (Arrivals)** âœ…

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### **Data Flow:**

```
SlidingWindowModel
  â†“ solve()
Production + Shipments (aggregate)
  â†“ apply_fefo_allocation()
FEFO Batches + Shipment Allocations
  â†“
Daily Snapshot Backend:
  - Production: FEFO batches where prod_date == snapshot_date
  - Arrivals: FEFO allocations where delivery_date == snapshot_date
  - Departures: FEFO allocations where departure_date == snapshot_date
  - Demand: FEFO allocations to demand nodes
  â†“
UI Display:
  - Production Activity table
  - Inflows section (production + arrivals)
  - Outflows section (departures + demand)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Complete Material Flow Tracking

### **Day 1 (Oct 29):**
```
6122 (Manufacturing):
  Inflows:
    âœ… Production: 5 batches, 6,225 units manufactured

  Outflows:
    âœ… Departures: 36 shipments to hubs/destinations

  Net: Production 6k, ship 6k â†’ inventory ~0

6104 (Hub):
  Inflows:
    âœ… Arrivals: 10 shipments from 6122

  Outflows:
    âœ… Departures: 20 shipments to spoke locations
    âœ… Demand: Some consumed at hub (if it's also demand node)

  Net: Receive from mfg, ship to spokes
```
