## ✅ What's Implemented

### **State-Aware Weighted Aging** ✅

**Your brilliant insight:** "Frozen ages slower than ambient/thawed"

**Implementation:**
```python
weighted_age = (days_in_ambient / 17) + (days_in_frozen / 120) + (days_in_thawed / 14)
```

**Result:**
- 60-day frozen batch: weighted_age = 0.5 (50% consumed)
- 8.5-day ambient batch: weighted_age = 0.5 (same!)
- **Frozen preserves 7× more shelf life** ✅

### **LP Optimizer** ✅

**File:** `src/analysis/lp_fefo_allocator.py`

**Formulation:**
```
minimize: Σ (weighted_age_at_delivery × allocation_quantity)

Subject to:
  - Each shipment fully satisfied
  - Batch capacity limits
  - Location/product/state compatibility
```

**Solver:** APPSI HiGHS (fast LP)

### **Integration** ✅

**File:** `src/optimization/sliding_window_model.py`

**Usage:**
```python
# Greedy (fast, default)
fefo = model.apply_fefo_allocation(method='greedy')

# LP (optimal, state-aware)
fefo = model.apply_fefo_allocation(method='lp')
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic fallback (LP fails → greedy)
- ✅ Location history tracking
- ✅ Daily snapshots for both methods
- ✅ Logging for diagnostics

---

## ⏳ Current Status: LP Feasibility

**Issue:** LP currently hits infeasibility on test case

**Likely causes:**
1. Constraint over-specification
2. Batch quantities insufficient after greedy pre-processing
3. Location incompatibility

**Debugging needed:**
- Check batch quantities vs shipment requirements
- Verify location matching logic
- Test with simpler case (fewer shipments)

**Workaround:** Automatic fallback to greedy (always works)

## 🎯 How to Use (Current State)

### **Method 1: Greedy (Default)** ✅ **WORKING**

```python
# In UI or code:
result = model.solve(...)
# Auto-uses greedy FEFO
```

**Performance:** ~1 second
**Result:** Chronological FEFO, oldest-first

### **Method 2: LP (Experimental)** ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**

```python
# Explicit LP call:
result = model.solve(...)
fefo = model.apply_fefo_allocation(method='lp')

# Falls back to greedy if LP infeasible
```

**Performance:** ~5-10 seconds (when working)
**Result:** Optimal weighted-age allocation

## 📊 Expected Differences: LP vs Greedy

### **WA Route (Lineage → 6130):**

**Greedy:**
```
Uses oldest calendar-age batch from Lineage
  - Batch: 25 days old, frozen
  - Delivery: 7 days transit
  - Age at destination: 32 days calendar
```

**LP (When Working):**
```
Uses oldest weighted-age batch from Lineage
  - Batch: 25 days frozen = 25/120 = 0.208 weighted
  - Minimizes weighted age at destination
  - Better shelf life preservation
```

### **Frozen Storage Benefit:**

**Example:**
```
Available batches:
  A: 60 days frozen (weighted: 0.5)
  B: 10 days ambient (weighted: 0.588)

Greedy: Uses A (older calendar)
LP: Uses B! (older weighted age)

Result: Frozen batch preserved for later use ✅
```

## 🔧 Next Steps (Debugging)

### **For Me:**

1. **Debug LP infeasibility** (30 min)
   - Add constraint diagnostics
   - Check batch/shipment compatibility
   - Test with minimal case

2. **Fix and validate** (30 min)
   - Ensure LP gives feasible solutions
   - Compare LP vs greedy allocations
   - Verify weighted aging works

3. **Performance tuning** (15 min)
   - Measure solve time with full horizon
   - Add progress logging

**Total:** ~1-2 hours to complete

### **For You:**

**Current state:**
```bash
git pull
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

**You have:**
- ✅ Greedy FEFO (working perfectly)

## 💡 Why Weighted Aging Matters

**Your frozen buffer route (WA):**
- Ambient → Frozen (Lineage) → Thawed (6130)
- 7-day transit time
- Need to use batches efficiently

**Weighted aging ensures:**
- Frozen batches properly valued
- Optimal allocation to long-transit routes
- Minimizes waste at destinations
- Better customer satisfaction

**This is advanced supply chain optimization!** 🎯
