### ⏭️ 2. UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md (INSERT REQUIRED)

**Location:** `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/docs/UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md`

**Required Insert:** Add Section 6 before existing Section 8 (line 686)

**Content to Add:**

```markdown
## 6. SOLVER SELECTION AND PERFORMANCE (2025-10-19)

### 6.1 Recommended Solver: HiGHS

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install highspy
```

**Performance Comparison (4-week horizon, binary product_produced):**

| Solver | Solve Time | Speedup | Notes |
|--------|------------|---------|-------|
| **HiGHS** | **96s** | **Baseline (recommended)** | Modern MIP solver, superior presolve |
| CBC | 226s | 2.35x slower | Legacy solver, basic heuristics |
| Gurobi | ~30-40s (est.) | 2-3x faster | Commercial (requires license) |
| CPLEX | ~30-40s (est.) | 2-3x faster | Commercial (requires license) |

**Why HiGHS Outperforms CBC:**
1. **Aggressive presolve**: Reduces problem by 62% (33K → 12K rows)
2. **Symmetry detection**: Finds 4 symmetry generators (CBC: 0)
3. **Modern heuristics**: Feasibility Jump, Sub-MIP, Randomized Rounding
4. **Efficient cutting planes**: 9,827 cuts generated
5. **Minimal branching**: Only 3 B&B nodes for 4-week problem

### 6.2 Binary vs Continuous Variables

**With HiGHS:**
- Continuous: 35-45s (fastest)
- **Binary: 96s** (acceptable, proper SKU selection)
- **Recommendation**: Use Binary with HiGHS for correctness

**With CBC:**
- Continuous: 35-45s
- Binary: 226s (5x slower)
- **Recommendation**: Use Continuous or switch to HiGHS

### 6.3 Warmstart Status

**HiGHS:** Warmstart has **zero effect** (96.0s vs 96.2s)
- Likely discarded during aggressive presolve
- **Recommendation**: Do not use warmstart with HiGHS

**CBC:** Warmstart **conflicts with optimal** (makes solving slower)
- Campaign pattern (2-3 SKUs) vs optimal (5 SKUs) mismatch
- **Recommendation**: Do not use warmstart with CBC

### 6.4 Configuration

**Recommended Configuration:**
```python
result = model.solve(
    solver_name='highs',     # Recommended
    use_warmstart=False,     # Not beneficial
    time_limit_seconds=120,  # Completes in ~96s
    mip_gap=0.01,
)
```

**Solver Selection Guidelines:**
- **HiGHS**: Default for all MIP problems with binary variables
- **CBC**: Fallback if HiGHS unavailable (2.35x slower)
- **Gurobi/CPLEX**: Premium performance (requires license)

### 6.5 Performance by Horizon

| Horizon | HiGHS | CBC | Speedup |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1 week  | ~2s   | 5-10s | 2.5-5x |
| 2 weeks | 10-20s | 40-80s | 4x |
| 4 weeks | 96s | 226s | 2.35x |
| 8 weeks | ~200s (est.) | 450-600s (est.) | 2-3x |

**Conclusion:** HiGHS enables practical binary variable optimization with acceptable solve times across all planning horizons.

## 2. Why Use HiGHS?

### Performance Benefits

For this application's **binary variable optimization** (product_produced variables), HiGHS delivers:

- **2.35x faster** than CBC for 4-week horizons
- **4x faster** than CBC for 2-week horizons
- **Practical binary enforcement** (96s vs 226s with CBC)

### Technical Advantages

1. **Aggressive Presolve:**

   - Eliminates redundant constraints
   - Tightens variable bounds automatically

2. **Symmetry Detection:**
   - Finds 4 symmetry generators in typical problems
   - CBC finds 0 (no symmetry detection)
   - Reduces branching tree size significantly

3. **Modern Heuristics:**
   - Feasibility Jump (finds solutions quickly)
   - Sub-MIP solving (solves smaller subproblems)
   - Randomized Rounding (diversifies search)

4. **Efficient Cutting Planes:**
   - Generates 9,827 cuts for 4-week problems
   - Mix-integer rounding (MIR) cuts
   - Gomory cuts
   - Clique cuts

5. **Minimal Branching:**
   - Only 3 B&B nodes for 4-week problems
   - CBC requires 50-100+ nodes
   - Faster convergence to optimal solution

## 3. Installation

### Python Package (Recommended)

```bash
pip install highspy
```

**Verify Installation:**
```python
import highspy
print(f"HiGHS version: {highspy.__version__}")

## 4. Performance Characteristics

### Solve Time by Planning Horizon

| Horizon | HiGHS | CBC | Speedup |
|---------|-------|-----|---------|
| 1 week  | 2s    | 5-10s | 2.5-5x |
| 2 weeks | 10-20s | 40-80s | 4x |
| 4 weeks | 96s | 226s | 2.35x |
| 8 weeks | ~200s | 450-600s | 2-3x |

### Problem Size Scaling

**4-week horizon:**
- Variables: ~20,000-40,000
- Constraints: ~10,000-15,000
- Binary variables: ~140 (product_produced)
- Integer variables: ~18,675 (pallet_count, if enabled)

**Presolve Performance:**
- Original rows: 33,000
- After presolve: 12,000 (62% reduction)
- Original cols: 35,000
- After presolve: 13,000 (63% reduction)

### Warmstart Effect

**HiGHS: Zero benefit**
- With warmstart: 96.0s
- Without warmstart: 96.2s
- Difference: Negligible (0.2s)

**Reason:** Aggressive presolve discards warmstart hints

**Recommendation:** Do NOT use warmstart with HiGHS

## 5. Configuration

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.optimization.unified_node_model import UnifiedNodeModel

model = UnifiedNodeModel(
    locations=locations,
    routes=routes,
    trucks=trucks,
    demand_forecast=demand,
    labor_calendar=labor,
    cost_structure=costs,
    start_date=start,
    end_date=end,
)

result = model.solve(
    solver_name='highs',     # Use HiGHS solver
    time_limit_seconds=120,  # 2 minutes (completes in ~96s)
    mip_gap=0.01,            # 1% optimality gap
)
```

### Advanced Options

```python
result = model.solve(
    solver_name='highs',
    solver_options={
        'time_limit': 120,       # Time limit in seconds
        'mip_rel_gap': 0.01,     # Relative MIP gap tolerance
        'threads': 4,             # Parallel threads (optional)
        'presolve': 'on',         # Enable presolve (default)
        'parallel': 'on',         # Enable parallelization (optional)
    },
    tee=True,  # Print solver output
)
```

### Solver Detection

HiGHS is auto-detected if installed:

```python
# Check availability
from pyomo.opt import SolverFactory

solver = SolverFactory('highs')
if solver.available():
    print("HiGHS is available")
else:
    print("HiGHS not found, falling back to CBC")
```

## 6. Comparison with Other Solvers

### Open-Source Solvers

| Solver | Speed | Features | License | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **HiGHS** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | MIT | **Best choice** |
| CBC | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | EPL | Fallback |
| GLPK | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | GPL | Not recommended |

### Commercial Solvers

| Solver | Speed | Cost | License Required |
|--------|-------|------|------------------|
| Gurobi | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $$$$ | Yes (academic free) |
| CPLEX | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $$$$ | Yes (academic free) |

**Performance Estimate:**
- Gurobi/CPLEX: ~30-40s for 4-week horizon (2-3x faster than HiGHS)
- Worth the cost only for very large problems (8+ weeks)

### When to Use Each Solver

**HiGHS:**
- Default choice for all problems
- Binary variable optimization
- 1-8 week planning horizons
- Production use

**CBC:**
- HiGHS not available
- Legacy systems
- Continuous relaxation only

**Gurobi/CPLEX:**
- Very large problems (10+ weeks)
- Need absolute fastest solve times
- Have license available

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Issue: HiGHS Not Found

**Error:**
```
ApplicationError: No usable solver 'highs' found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install highspy
# OR
conda install -c conda-forge highs
```

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** HiGHS taking longer than expected (>120s for 4-week)

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check problem size:
   ```python
   print(f"Variables: {model.model.nvariables()}")
   print(f"Constraints: {model.model.nconstraints()}")
   ```

2. Check binary variable count:
   ```python
   binary_vars = sum(1 for v in model.model.component_data_objects(Var)
                     if v.domain == Binary)
   print(f"Binary variables: {binary_vars}")
   ```

**Solutions:**
- Disable pallet-based storage costs (reduces integer vars by ~18,675)
- Reduce planning horizon (8 weeks → 4 weeks)
- Use continuous relaxation for testing

### Issue: Out of Memory

**Symptoms:** Solver crashes or system freezes

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce problem size:
   - Shorter planning horizon
   - Fewer products/locations
   - Disable batch tracking

2. Increase system resources:
   - Close other applications
   - Add more RAM
   - Use swap space
