  - Location, Product, Date
  - Original Quantity (read-only)
  - Adjusted Quantity (editable)
  - Delta (calculated)
  - % Change (calculated)
- Direct cell editing for quick single adjustments
- Sorting and filtering capabilities
- Color-coded changes (displayed via Delta column)

### 2. Bulk Edit Operations
**Available Operations:**
- **Percentage Adjustment:** Increase/decrease by X%
- **Absolute Adjustment:** Add/subtract X units

**Filtering Options:**
- By location(s)
- By product(s)
- By date range
- Apply to all (no filters)

**Preview Before Apply:**
- Shows number of rows affected
- Displays total delta
- Calculates percentage change
- Allows cancel before committing

### 3. Change Tracking
**Summary Metrics:**
- Total forecasts modified
- Total delta (units)
- Percentage change (overall)
- Number of increases/decreases
- Locations, products, and dates affected

**Undo Functionality:**
- "Undo Last Change" button with stack-based history
- "Reset All Changes" button with confirmation dialog

### 4. Real-Time Validation
**Error Detection:**
- ❌ Negative quantities (prevents application)
- Shows count of invalid forecasts

**Warning Detection:**
- ⚠️ Extreme changes (>100% or >10,000 units)
- ⚠️ Large total demand change (>50%)
- Allows application but flags for review

**Validation Status:**
- ✅ "All changes valid" when no issues
- Clear badge-based visual feedback

### 5. Impact Preview
**Metrics Displayed:**
- Original demand (total units)
- Adjusted demand (total units)
- Labor hours impact (estimated)
- Truck capacity impact (estimated)

**Visual Comparison:**
- Line chart showing daily demand (original vs. adjusted)
- Highlights significant changes (>20%) with markers
- Interactive Plotly chart with hover details

### 6. Save and Apply
**Action Options:**
- **Apply Changes:** Updates session state and invalidates old planning results
- **Export to Excel:** Downloads CSV with all changes
- **Reset All:** Reverts to original forecast
- **Undo Last:** Steps back through change history

**Re-Planning Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Apply Changes"
2. Confirmation dialog shows impact summary
3. On confirm:
   - Updates `st.session_state.forecast` with new Forecast object
   - Clears `planning_complete` flag
   - Removes old `production_schedule`, `shipments`, `truck_plan`, `cost_breakdown`
   - Clears `optimization_results` if present
4. Success message with navigation links to Planning/Optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
1. Load: Forecast (session_state) → DataFrame (for editing)
2. Edit: User modifies Adjusted_Quantity column
3. Track: Calculate Delta and Pct_Change columns
4. Validate: Check for errors/warnings
5. Preview: Calculate impact metrics and charts
6. Apply: DataFrame → Forecast (session_state) → Clear old results
```

### Session State Variables

**Created by Forecast Editor:**
- `adjusted_forecast_df`: DataFrame with current edits
- `forecast_undo_stack`: List of previous states for undo
- `confirm_reset`: Boolean flag for reset confirmation
- `confirm_apply`: Boolean flag for apply confirmation
- `forecast_changes_applied`: Boolean flag indicating changes were applied

**Updated by Forecast Editor:**
- `forecast`: Updated with adjusted quantities on apply
- `planning_complete`: Set to False to trigger re-planning
- `optimization_complete`: Set to False if exists
- Clears: `production_schedule`, `shipments`, `truck_plan`, `cost_breakdown`, `optimization_results`

### Helper Functions

**Core Functions (tested):**
```python
forecast_to_dataframe(forecast) -> pd.DataFrame
dataframe_to_forecast(df, original_forecast) -> Forecast
identify_changes(df) -> pd.DataFrame
get_change_summary(df) -> Dict[str, Any]
validate_forecast_changes(df) -> Dict[str, Any]
apply_bulk_adjustment(df, operation, value, filters) -> pd.DataFrame
calculate_impact_metrics(df) -> Dict[str, float]
create_comparison_chart(df) -> go.Figure
apply_forecast_changes() -> None
```

### Design System Integration

Uses Phase 1 design system throughout:
- `apply_custom_css()` for styling
- `section_header()` for page sections
- `colored_metric()` for metric cards
- `success_badge()`, `warning_badge()`, `error_badge()` for status indicators
- `info_box()` for informational messages

## User Workflow

### Typical Use Case: Quick Adjustment

**Scenario:** Sales calls Monday morning: "Customer X increased Thursday order by 2,000 units"

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "Forecast Editor" page
2. Use filters to find Thursday + Customer X location
3. Click in "Adjusted Quantity" cell and type new value (or use bulk edit +2000)
4. Verify change in summary metrics (Delta: +2,000)
5. Check validation (✅ All changes valid)
6. Preview impact (Labor: +1.4 hours, Trucks: +0.14)
7. Click "Apply Changes" → Confirm
8. Navigate to Planning Workflow to re-run

**Time Saved:** ~15 minutes (no Excel download/edit/upload)

### Advanced Use Case: Bulk Adjustment

**Scenario:** Increase all forecasts for Location 6104 by 20%

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "Forecast Editor" page
2. Open "Bulk Edit Operations" expander
3. Select "Percentage Adjustment" operation
4. Enter value: 20
5. Filter: Select "6104" in Locations
6. Click "Preview" to see impact (e.g., 45 rows affected, +5,000 units)
7. Click "Apply Bulk Adjustment"
8. Review changes in table (Delta column shows increases)
9. Validate and apply changes
10. Re-run planning

## Integration Points

### With Planning Workflow (Page 3)
- Cleared flags: `planning_complete = False`
- Cleared results: `production_schedule`, `shipments`, `truck_plan`, `cost_breakdown`
- User guided to re-run planning after applying changes

### With Optimization (Page 10)
- Cleared flag: `optimization_complete = False`
- Cleared results: `optimization_results`
- User can navigate directly to optimization after changes

### With Data Summary (Page 2)
- Navigation button to return to data summary
- Forecast statistics will reflect changes after apply

## Error Handling

**Missing Data:**
- No forecast loaded → Info box with link to Upload page
- Empty forecast → Warning message

**Invalid Edits:**
- Negative quantities → Error badge, prevents application
- Extreme values → Warning badge, allows but flags

**Session State Issues:**
- Missing `adjusted_forecast_df` → Auto-initialized from `forecast`
- Empty undo stack → Undo button disabled

## Notes for Developers

### Code Structure
- **Helper functions first:** All utility functions defined at top
- **Main page logic:** Structured flow from top to bottom
- **Session state management:** Explicit initialization and updates
- **Component reuse:** Uses existing design system components

### Style Guidelines
- Follows project coding standards from CLAUDE.md
- Type hints on all function parameters
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Clear variable naming
- Separation of concerns (data, UI, validation)

### Performance Considerations
- DataFrame operations are efficient for typical forecast sizes (<10,000 rows)
- Session state prevents unnecessary recomputation
- Undo stack stored in memory (consider limit for very large forecasts)
- Plotly charts use efficient data structures

### Accessibility
- Clear labels on all inputs
- Status badges with emoji icons
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Navigation buttons for easy workflow transitions

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check unit tests for usage examples
2. Review helper function docstrings
3. Examine session state management in `ui/session_state.py`
4. Refer to design system components in `ui/components/styling.py`
