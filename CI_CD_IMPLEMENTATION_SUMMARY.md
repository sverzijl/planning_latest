- Matrix strategy: Python 3.11 and 3.12
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Comprehensive test execution (266+ tests)
- Labor validation integration tests
- Labor calendar validation tests

**Expected Runtime:** 5-10 minutes per Python version

**Configuration:**

---

## Repository Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Badge URLs (Required)

In `README.md`, replace `USER/REPO` with your repository:

```markdown
![Tests](https://github.com/sverzijl/planning_latest/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
![Coverage](https://github.com/sverzijl/planning_latest/workflows/Coverage/badge.svg)
```

### Step 2: Validate Setup (Recommended)

```bash
python .github/workflows/validate_setup.py
```

Expected output: "✓ All validation checks passed!"

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin master
```

### Step 4: Monitor First Run

1. Go to GitHub repository → Actions tab
2. Watch workflow execution
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Check badges appear in README

### Step 5: Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

Settings → Branches → Add rule for `master`:
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Select: `test (3.11)`, `test (3.12)`

### Step 6: Setup Codecov (Optional)

For private repositories:
1. Visit codecov.io and sign in with GitHub
2. Add repository
3. Copy token
4. Add as GitHub secret: `CODECOV_TOKEN`

For public repositories: No token needed, automatic

## Workflow Execution Flow

### On Pull Request

1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Makes changes and commits
3. Pushes to GitHub
4. Creates pull request
5. **GitHub Actions triggers:**
   - Test workflow (Python 3.11) starts
   - Test workflow (Python 3.12) starts
6. Both workflows run in parallel (~5-10 min each)
7. Results appear in PR Checks tab
8. Status badges update in README
9. Merge allowed only if all tests pass (with branch protection)

### On Push to Master

1. Code pushed or merged to master branch
2. **GitHub Actions triggers:**
   - Test workflow (Python 3.11)
   - Test workflow (Python 3.12)
   - Coverage workflow (Python 3.11)
3. All workflows run in parallel
4. Coverage report uploaded to Codecov
5. Badges update on README

---

## Key Features

### 1. Dependency Caching
**Benefit:** Faster workflow execution (3-5x speedup)

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('requirements.txt') }}
```

### 2. Matrix Strategy
**Benefit:** Test compatibility across Python versions

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.11', '3.12']
```

### 3. Fail-Fast Disabled
**Benefit:** See all test failures, not just first one

```yaml
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --maxfail=5
```

### 4. Specific Test Categories
**Benefit:** Ensure critical tests always run

```yaml
- name: Run labor validation tests specifically
  run: pytest tests/test_labor_validation_integration.py -v
```

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Execution Times

| Workflow | Python Version | Expected Time |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Tests | 3.11 | 5-10 minutes |
| Tests | 3.12 | 5-10 minutes |
| Coverage | 3.11 | 5-10 minutes |

**Total parallel time:** ~10 minutes (all workflows run simultaneously)

### Optimization Strategies Implemented

1. ✅ Pip dependency caching
2. ✅ Matrix strategy for parallel execution
3. ✅ Coverage only on main branch (not PRs)
4. ✅ Fail-fast on errors (maxfail=5)
5. ✅ Short traceback format (--tb=short)

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Workflows Not Appearing

**Solution:**
- Check YAML syntax: `python .github/workflows/validate_setup.py`
- Verify files in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings

### Issue: Tests Pass Locally but Fail in CI

**Common Causes:**
- Different Python version (test with 3.11 and 3.12)
- Missing dependency in requirements.txt
- File path issues (use Path from pathlib)
- Timezone/locale differences

**Debug:**
```yaml
- name: Debug environment
  run: |
    python --version
    pip list
    pwd
```

### Issue: Badge Not Updating

**Solution:**
1. Check badge URL matches repository exactly
2. Ensure workflow name matches: `name: Tests`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to update

---

## Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - 266+ tests covering all modules
2. ✅ **Multiple Python Versions** - Ensure compatibility
3. ✅ **Dependency Caching** - Fast workflow execution
4. ✅ **Clear Documentation** - Quick start + detailed guides
5. ✅ **Validation Script** - Automated setup verification
6. ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Catch issues before push
7. ✅ **Coverage Tracking** - Maintain quality standards
8. ✅ **Status Badges** - Visible quality indicators

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. Update badge URLs in README.md with actual repository name
2. Push to GitHub to trigger first workflow run
3. Verify workflows execute successfully
4. Check badges display correctly

### Short-term (Recommended)
1. Setup branch protection rules
2. Configure Codecov for coverage tracking

4. Add CI/CD status check to PR template

### Long-term (Optional)
1. Add performance benchmarking workflow
2. Implement deployment workflow for releases
3. Add security scanning (Dependabot, CodeQL)
4. Setup automated dependency updates
5. Add Docker build and publish workflow
