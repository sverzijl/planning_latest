# Planning Horizon UI Implementation - Phase 2B

## Summary

Successfully implemented a planning horizon control in the Streamlit Planning page (`ui/pages/2_Planning.py`) that allows users to specify the planning horizon in weeks.

## Implementation Details

### Location
File: `/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/ui/pages/2_Planning.py`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Planning Horizon UI Control (Lines 420-464)

**New Section Header:**
- Added "Planning Horizon" section with calendar icon

**Radio Button Control:**
- Two modes: "Auto (from forecast)" and "Custom (weeks)"
- Default: Auto mode (maintains backward compatibility)
- Clear help text explaining each mode

**Number Input for Custom Weeks:**
- Minimum: 4 weeks
- Maximum: 104 weeks (2 years)
- Default: 26 weeks (6 months)
- Step: 1 week increments
- Only appears when "Custom (weeks)" mode is selected

**End Date Calculation and Display:**
- Calculates: `end_date = forecast_start + (weeks × 7)` days
- Displays calculated end date to user in friendly format
- Example: "📅 Planning horizon: 26 weeks (ending 2025-10-09)"

**Labor Calendar Coverage Warning:**
- Automatically checks if custom horizon exceeds labor calendar coverage
- Shows warning if planning extends beyond available labor data
- Warning is informative (not blocking) - optimization can still proceed

#### 2. Updated Model Creation (Line 504)

**Pass Custom End Date to Model:**
```python
model = IntegratedProductionDistributionModel(
    # ... existing parameters ...
    end_date=custom_end_date,  # Use custom horizon if specified, else None (auto-calculate)
)
```

## User Interface

### Auto Mode (Default)
```
Planning Horizon
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

◉ Auto (from forecast)
○ Custom (weeks)

Planning horizon mode:
Help: Auto mode calculates horizon from forecast range.
      Custom mode lets you specify weeks to plan ahead.
```

### Custom Mode
```
Planning Horizon
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

○ Auto (from forecast)
◉ Custom (weeks)

Planning horizon (weeks): [26]
Help: Number of weeks to plan ahead. Minimum 4 weeks,
      maximum 104 weeks (2 years).

ℹ️ Planning horizon: 26 weeks (ending 2025-10-09)

⚠️ Planning horizon (2025-10-09) extends beyond labor
   calendar coverage (2025-08-15). Extended dates will
   issue warnings but optimization will proceed.
```

## Technical Details

### Backward Compatibility
- **Preserved:** Default behavior (Auto mode) works exactly as before
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality unchanged
- **Graceful Fallback:** If custom_end_date is None, model auto-calculates from forecast

### Edge Case Handling
1. **No forecast data:** Gracefully handles missing forecast entries
2. **Labor calendar warnings:** Non-blocking warnings when horizon exceeds coverage
3. **Minimum/Maximum bounds:** Enforced at UI level (4-104 weeks)
4. **Date calculation:** Uses timedelta for accurate week-to-day conversion

### Variable Naming
- `planning_horizon_mode`: Radio button selection ("Auto" or "Custom")
- `planning_horizon_weeks`: Number input value (only when custom mode)
- `custom_end_date`: Calculated end date (passed to model as `end_date`)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] **Syntax validation:** Python AST parse successful
- [x] **Auto mode:** Works as before (no changes to existing behavior)
- [x] **Custom mode UI:** Number input appears only in custom mode
- [x] **End date calculation:** Correct math (weeks × 7 days)
- [x] **Labor calendar warning:** Displays when horizon exceeds coverage
- [x] **Model integration:** `end_date` parameter passed correctly
- [x] **Backward compatibility:** Default None maintains auto-calculation

## UI/UX Considerations

### Design Decisions

1. **Two-column layout:** Radio button in left column, number input in right
   - Provides visual balance and clear grouping

2. **Progressive disclosure:** Number input only appears when needed
   - Reduces cognitive load in Auto mode
   - Makes UI cleaner and more focused

3. **Immediate feedback:** Shows calculated end date and warnings instantly
   - Users see the impact of their week selection
   - Labor calendar warnings help users make informed decisions

4. **Clear labeling:** "Auto (from forecast)" vs "Custom (weeks)"
   - Explicit about what each mode does
   - Help text provides additional context

5. **Sensible defaults:**
   - Auto mode selected by default (most common use case)
   - 26 weeks (6 months) for custom mode (typical planning horizon)

### Information Architecture

**Placement:** After "Optimization Settings", before "Run Optimization"
- Logical flow: Configure solver → Set options → Define horizon → Run
- Groups all planning configuration in one area
- Separates from execution controls

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Section header (Planning Horizon) establishes context
- Radio button choice is primary decision
- Number input is secondary (conditional)
- Info messages provide feedback

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Date range picker:** Allow direct start/end date selection instead of weeks
2. **Preset buttons:** Quick selections (4w, 8w, 13w, 26w, 52w)
3. **Visual timeline:** Show forecast range vs planning horizon graphically
4. **Validation:** Check if custom horizon makes sense for specific forecast
5. **Persist preference:** Remember user's last selection in session state
