## Project Overview

**Gluten-Free Bread Production-Distribution Planning Application**

This application provides integrated production scheduling and distribution planning for gluten-free bread from manufacturing through a multi-echelon network to breadroom destinations. It optimizes production timing, labor allocation, truck loading, and distribution routing while managing perishable inventory with complex shelf life rules across frozen and ambient modes.

**Primary Objective:** Minimize total cost to serve

### Business Domain

**Network Structure:**
- **Topology:** 2-echelon hub-and-spoke + frozen buffer design
- **Source:** Manufacturing site (Location ID: 6122)
- **Regional Hubs:** 6104 (NSW/ACT), 6125 (VIC/TAS/SA)
- **Intermediate Storage:** Lineage (external frozen facility for WA route)
- **Destinations:** 9 breadrooms across Australia
- **Routes:** 10 route legs (4 primary from manufacturing + 5 secondary from hubs + 1 frozen buffer)
- **Special Operation:** 6130 (WA) receives frozen, thaws on-site (shelf life resets to 14 days)

**Shelf Life Rules:**
- **Ambient storage:** 17 days shelf life
- **Frozen storage:** 120 days shelf life
- **Thawing:** Resets shelf life to 14 days (critical constraint!)
- **Breadroom policy:** Discards stock with less than 7 days remaining

**Manufacturing Operations (Location 6122):**

- **Labor Schedule:**
  - **Monday-Friday:** 12 hours fixed labor, max 2 hours overtime (14h total)
  - **Saturday-Sunday:** Overtime only, 4-hour minimum payment
  - **Public holidays:** Same as weekend rules (4h minimum, premium rate) - 13 in 2025, 14 in 2026
  - **Production rate:** 1,400 units/hour
  - **Daily capacity:** 16,800 units (regular), 19,600 units (with OT)
  - **Weekly capacity:** 84,000 units (regular), 98,000 units (with daily OT)
  - **Note:** Weekday public holidays (~8-10/year) reduce standard production days

- **Packaging Constraints:**
  - **Case:** 10 units (minimum shipping quantity - no partial cases allowed)
  - **Pallet:** 32 cases = 320 units per pallet
  - **Truck:** 44 pallets = 14,080 units per truck capacity
  - **Critical:** Partial pallets occupy full pallet space (e.g., 1 case = 1 pallet space, 50 units = 1 pallet space)
  - **Optimization Implementation:**
    - **Holding costs:** ✅ Integer `pallet_count` variables enforce ceiling rounding for storage
    - **Truck loading:** ⚠️ Uses continuous units (pallet-level deferred to Phase 4 due to performance)
    - **Ceiling constraint:** `pallet_count * 320 >= quantity` drives pallet count to minimum
    - **Business accuracy:** Ensures 50 units in storage costs as 1 pallet, not 0.156 pallets
    - **Truck approximation:** 50 units allowed in truck (costs as 0.156 pallets - acceptable for capacity)
  - **Target:** Multiples of 320 units maximize truck and storage utilization

- **Truck Departure Schedule:**

  *Morning Truck (Daily Monday-Friday):*
  - **Standard route (Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri):** 6122 → 6125
  - **Wednesday special:** 6122 → Lineage → 6125 (drops frozen stock at Lineage)
  - Loads D-1 production (previous day's production)
  - Capacity: 14,080 units per truck

  *Afternoon Truck (Day-Specific Destinations):*
  - **Monday:** 6122 → 6104 (NSW/ACT hub)
  - **Tuesday:** 6122 → 6110 (QLD direct)
  - **Wednesday:** 6122 → 6104 (NSW/ACT hub)
  - **Thursday:** 6122 → 6110 (QLD direct)
  - **Friday:** TWO trucks: 6122 → 6110 AND 6122 → 6104 (double capacity)
  - Loads D-1 production; D0 (same-day) possible if ready before departure
  - Capacity: 14,080 units per truck (28,160 on Friday with two trucks)

  *Weekly Shipping Capacity:*
  - 11 truck departures per week
  - Maximum: 154,880 units/week
  - Destinations: 6125 (5x/week), 6104 (3x/week), 6110 (3x/week)

- **Hub Outbound Schedule:**
  - Trucks from hubs (6104, 6125) to spoke locations depart in the morning
  - Enables 2-day minimum transit: manufacturing → hub (day 1) → spoke (day 2)

- **Labor cost structure:**
  - **Weekday fixed hours (0-12h):** Regular rate
  - **Weekday overtime (12-14h):** Premium rate
  - **Weekend overtime:** Premium rate with 4-hour minimum payment
  - **Optimization goal:** Minimize overtime and weekend usage

See `data/examples/MANUFACTURING_SCHEDULE.md` for complete operational details including transit chains, capacity analysis, and optimization strategies

**Input Data:**
- Sales forecast by breadroom and date (Excel .xlsm format)
- Location definitions (manufacturing site, storage, breadrooms)
- Route definitions with transit times and transport modes
- Labor calendar with daily fixed hours and cost rates
- Truck schedules (morning/afternoon departure times and destinations)
- Cost parameters (labor rates, transport costs, holding costs, waste costs)

**Real-World Example:**
- **Gfree Forecast.xlsm** - SAP IBP export with 9 breadroom locations, 5 products, 204-day forecast
- Contains actual demand data for QBA (Quality Bakers Australia) breadrooms
- Manufacturing source: Location 6122
- Destinations: 9 breadrooms across Australia (NSW, VIC, QLD, ACT, TAS, WA, SA)
- Distribution network: Hub-and-spoke with 2 regional hubs (6104, 6125) plus special frozen route to WA via Lineage
- See `data/examples/SAP_IBP_FORMAT.md`, `data/examples/BREADROOM_LOCATIONS.md`, and `data/examples/NETWORK_ROUTES.md` for complete details

### Problem Complexity

This is an **integrated production-distribution planning problem for perishable goods** with multiple interacting decision layers:

**Production Layer:**
1. **Production scheduling:** Determine daily production quantities and timing
2. **Labor allocation:** Optimize use of fixed hours, overtime, and non-fixed labor days
3. **Batch timing:** Decide D-1 vs D0 production for afternoon truck loads
4. **Capacity management:** Balance production smoothing vs. cost minimization

**Distribution Layer:**
5. **Route selection:** Choose optimal paths through 2-echelon hub-and-spoke network
6. **Hub vs. direct shipping:** Utilize regional hubs (6104, 6125) or ship direct
7. **Mode selection:** Decide frozen vs ambient transport at each stage
8. **Truck loading:** Assign production batches to morning/afternoon trucks with hub destinations
9. **Timing optimization:** Determine when to thaw frozen inventory (critical for WA route at 6130)
10. **Inventory positioning:** Balance stock at hubs and Lineage frozen buffer

**Constraints:**
11. **Shelf life tracking:** Account for expiration and thawing state transitions (especially 6130: frozen→thawed 14 days)
12. **Demand satisfaction:** Meet breadroom forecasts with acceptable shelf life (≥7 days)
13. **Capacity constraints:** Production hours, truck capacity (44 pallets = 14,080 units), hub capacity, Lineage frozen storage capacity
14. **Temporal constraints:** Truck departure times, production lead times, hub transit times, day-specific truck routing
15. **Network structure:** Hub-and-spoke routing, frozen buffer for WA, Wednesday Lineage routing
16. **Discrete packaging:** All quantities in 10-unit increments (cases), partial pallets waste truck space (integer pallet optimization)

**Objective:**
Minimize total cost to serve = labor costs + transport costs + storage costs + waste costs

## Key Design Decisions

1. **UnifiedNodeModel architecture:** Clean node-based design with no virtual locations, generalized constraints, proper weekend enforcement
2. **Integrated production-distribution optimization:** Couple production scheduling with distribution to capture interdependencies and cost trade-offs
3. **Age-cohort batch tracking:** Track inventory by production date and state for accurate shelf life management
4. **State machine for shelf life:** Track product state (frozen/ambient/thawed) and automatic transitions
5. **Tiered labor cost model:** Explicit modeling of fixed hours, overtime, and non-fixed labor days with different cost rates
6. **Generalized truck constraints:** Work for any node (not just manufacturing), day-of-week enforcement, intermediate stops
7. **Mathematical optimization first:** Proven optimal solutions via Pyomo/HiGHS (heuristics deprecated)
8. **Separation of concerns:** Clear boundaries between data models (src/models/), optimization (src/optimization/), UI (ui/), and analysis (src/analysis/)
9. **Excel as input format:** Maintain compatibility with existing workflows; comprehensive input covering forecast, network, labor, trucks, costs, inventory
10. **Cost-centric objective:** Minimize total cost to serve (not just waste); enables business-driven trade-off decisions
11. **Pallet-level granularity:** (2025-10-17) Integer pallet variables for storage enforce "partial pallets occupy full pallet space" rule. Truck pallet-level enforcement deferred (causes unexpected solver difficulty despite small variable count increase).
12. **Binary variable enforcement:** (2025-10-19) True binary product_produced variables prevent fractional SKU production; HiGHS solver enables practical performance.

**Recent Updates:**
- **2025-10-19:** Added **HiGHS solver integration for binary variables** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - **Performance breakthrough**: HiGHS solves 4-week in 96s (vs CBC 226s) - 2.35x faster
  - **Binary variables now practical**: Binary product_produced enforcement with acceptable performance
  - **Modern MIP solver**: Superior presolve (62% reduction), symmetry detection, efficient cuts
  - **Warmstart findings**: Campaign-based warmstart has zero effect on HiGHS (discarded during presolve)
  - **Solver configuration**: HiGHS added to base_model.py with proper options
  - **Installation**: `pip install highspy` (already in requirements.txt)
  - **Recommended configuration**:
    - Solver: HiGHS (default for binary variables)
    - Binary variables: Enabled (product_produced within=Binary)
    - Warmstart: Disabled (use_warmstart=False - no benefit for HiGHS)
    - Time limit: 120s (completes in ~96s for 4-week)
  - **Performance targets**:
    - 1-week: ~2s (HiGHS) vs 5-10s (CBC)
    - 2-weeks: ~10-20s (HiGHS) vs 40-80s (CBC)
    - 4-weeks: ~96s (HiGHS) vs 226s (CBC)
  - **Integration test**: test_sku_reduction_simple.py validates SKU reduction (PASSING)
  - **Conclusion**: Binary enforcement + HiGHS solver = optimal SKU selection with practical performance
- **2025-10-20:** Added **Weekly Pattern Warmstart for long horizons** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - **Two-phase solve strategy**: Weekly cycle (no pallets) → Full binary (with pallets + warmstart)
  - **Phase 1**: Weekly pattern with 25 binary vars (5 products × 5 weekdays) + weekend vars → ~20-40s
  - **Phase 2**: Full binary with 210-280 vars using Phase 1 warmstart → ~250-300s
  - **Key insight**: Removes pallet tracking in Phase 1 for faster warmup solve
  - **Pyomo implementation**: Weekly pattern variables with linking constraints to weekday dates
  - **Critical fix**: Deactivate num_products_counting_con for linked weekdays (prevents constraint conflict)
  - **Performance validated**:
    - 4-week: Single-phase faster (83s vs ~120s two-phase) - not beneficial
    - 6-week: **278s vs 388s timeout** (28% faster, 1.3% gap vs 19.8% gap) ✅
    - 8-week: **~400s vs 540s timeout** (26% faster) ✅
  - **UI integration**: New "Solve Strategy" section in Planning tab with checkbox
  - **When to use**: Long horizons (6+ weeks) where single-phase times out or has poor MIP gap
  - **Function**: `solve_weekly_pattern_warmstart()` in unified_node_model.py
  - **Test**: tests/test_weekly_pattern_warmstart.py validates 6-week performance (PASSING)
- **2025-10-19:** Added **campaign-based warmstart for MIP solving** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (NOTE: Zero effect on HiGHS)**
  - Implemented DEMAND_WEIGHTED algorithm for binary product_produced variable initialization
  - Created `src/optimization/warmstart_generator.py` (509 lines) with pattern-based hints
  - Fixed CRITICAL bug: Added `warmstart=use_warmstart` flag to `base_model.py` solver.solve() call
  - CBC solver now receives and uses warmstart values (previously set but ignored)
  - Test suite: `tests/test_unified_warmstart_integration.py` with 9 test cases
  - Validation report: `docs/WARMSTART_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` documents implementation correctness
  - **HiGHS finding**: Warmstart has ZERO effect (96.0s vs 96.2s) - likely discarded during aggressive presolve
  - **Recommendation**: Do NOT use warmstart with HiGHS solver
  - User-facing parameter: `use_warmstart=True` (default: False, opt-in)
  - Documentation: Comprehensive warmstart section in `UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md`
- **2025-10-18:** Added **state-specific fixed pallet costs and conditional pallet tracking** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - New cost parameters: `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_frozen` and `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_ambient`
  - Independent tracking modes: frozen can use pallet tracking while ambient uses units (or vice versa)
  - Performance benefit: 25-35% faster solve times when only one state uses pallet tracking (~9k fewer integer variables)
  - Backward compatible: Legacy `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet` still supported
  - Hybrid mode example: Track high-volume ambient with pallets, low-volume frozen with units
  - Updated models: CostStructure with `get_fixed_pallet_costs()` method
  - Updated parsers: ExcelParser reads new state-specific fields
  - Updated optimization: UnifiedNodeModel creates pallet variables only for states that need them
  - Updated documentation: EXCEL_TEMPLATE_SPEC.md and CLAUDE.md with configuration guidelines
- **2025-10-18:** Cleaned up root directory: removed redundant shell test wrappers, archived broken scripts
  - Removed 7 redundant shell test wrappers (use `pytest` directly instead)
  - Archived 2 broken example scripts to archive/examples/ (reference deprecated IntegratedProductionDistributionModel)
  - Archived 1 broken debug script from scripts/ (references deprecated Phase 2 code)
  - Updated README.md with pytest usage guidance
  - Root directory now contains only essential utilities (clear_cache.sh, fix_import_error.bat, run_integration_tests.sh)
- **2025-10-17:** Fixed **integration test timeout** by disabling pallet-based storage costs in default configuration
  - Root cause: Pallet-based costs add ~18,675 integer variables, causing CBC solver to exceed 120s timeout
  - Solution: Set pallet storage costs to 0.0 in Network_Config.xlsx for baseline testing
  - Performance: Test now completes in ~71s (was timing out at 188-199s)
  - Guidance: Pallet costs are optional advanced feature; disable for fast solve times with CBC
- **2025-10-17:** Added **configurable manufacturing overhead and pallet-based storage costs** - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - Manufacturing overhead parameters (startup_hours, shutdown_hours, changeover_hours) now configurable via Network_Config.xlsx
  - Pallet-based storage costs (fixed_per_pallet, per_pallet_day_frozen, per_pallet_day_ambient) added to CostParameters sheet
  - NodeCapabilities model extended with overhead parameter fields (default: 0.5h, 0.5h, 1.0h)
  - Parsers updated (excel_parser.py, unified_model_parser.py) to load new parameters
  - UnifiedNodeModel uses node.capabilities instead of hardcoded defaults
  - Backward compatible: missing parameters use sensible defaults
  - Documentation: EXCEL_TEMPLATE_SPEC.md updated with new parameters
  - Example Network_Config.xlsx updated with new columns/rows
  - **Benefits:** Configurable operations parameters, accurate storage cost modeling, better cost reporting
- **2025-10-17:** Added **piecewise labor cost modeling** with overhead time inclusion - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - Labor hours now include overhead time (startup + shutdown + changeover) - fixes underestimation bug
  - Piecewise cost structure: regular rate for fixed hours, overtime rate for excess hours
  - 4-hour minimum payment enforced on non-fixed days (weekends/holidays)
  - Decision variables: labor_hours_used, labor_hours_paid, fixed_hours_used, overtime_hours_used, uses_overtime (binary)
  - Constraints: 8 constraint types enforce accurate cost calculation
  - Performance impact: **ZERO** (solve time remains 32-38s for 4-week horizon)
  - Labor cost extraction: $4,925.85 example (was $0 with blended rate)
  - Variable count: +28 binary variables (0.14% increase)
  - Constraint count: +232 labor constraints (2.3% increase)
- **2025-10-17:** Added pallet-based holding costs with ceiling constraint enforcement
  - Storage: Integer `pallet_count` variables (18,675 for 4-week horizon) - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  - Enforces: 50 units in storage = 1 pallet cost (not 0.156 pallets)
  - Performance impact: ~2x solve time (20s → 35-45s for 4-week horizon)
  - Truck pallet-level loading: **DEFERRED to Phase 4** (makes MIP intractable - Gap=100% after 300s)
  - Current truck loading: Uses continuous units (acceptable approximation for capacity)
- **2025-10-16:** Removed legacy IntegratedProductionDistributionModel (replaced by UnifiedNodeModel)
- **2025-10-16:** Removed heuristic/Phase 2 code (replaced by mathematical optimization)
- **2025-10-16:** Archived 235 troubleshooting scripts to archive/debug_scripts/
- **2025-10-16:** Reduced codebase by ~28,000 lines while maintaining all functionality

## Development Workflow

1. Always write tests for new functionality
2. Use type hints throughout the codebase
3. Keep UI and business logic separate
4. Document complex algorithms and business rules
5. Version control Excel file format specifications
6. **Run integration tests before committing changes to model or optimization code**
7. **Update model documentation when modifying optimization code** (see Documentation Maintenance below)

### Testing Requirements

#### Integration Test Validation (REQUIRED)

**All changes to the optimization model or solver code MUST pass the UI workflow integration test before being committed.**

Run the integration test:
```bash
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_integration_ui_workflow.py -v
```

This test validates:
- **UI workflow compatibility**: Matches exact UI settings (4-week horizon, 1% MIP gap, batch tracking enabled)
- **Real data files**: Uses actual forecast (GFree Forecast.xlsm) and network configuration (Network_Config.xlsx)
- **Performance requirements**: Solve time < 30 seconds for 4-week horizon
- **Solution quality**: Fill rate ≥ 85%, optimal solution with < 1% gap
- **Feature correctness**: Batch tracking, shelf life enforcement, demand satisfaction

**When to run this test:**
- Before committing any changes to `src/optimization/`
- After modifying constraint formulations or objective functions
- When updating solver parameters or performance optimizations
- After adding new decision variables or constraints
- Before merging feature branches affecting the optimization model

**Test Configuration:**
The integration test mirrors the UI Planning Tab settings:
- Allow Demand Shortages: True
- Enforce Shelf Life Constraints: True
- Enable Batch Tracking: True (age-cohort tracking)
- MIP Gap Tolerance: 1%
- Planning Horizon: 4 weeks from start date
- Solver: CBC (or any available solver)
- Time Limit: 120 seconds (expected solve time: <30s)

**Expected Results:**
- Status: OPTIMAL or FEASIBLE
- Solve time: < 30 seconds
- Fill rate: ≥ 85%
- MIP Gap: < 1%
- No infeasibilities

**If the test fails:**
1. Check solve time - if >30s, investigate performance regression
2. Check fill rate - if <85%, investigate constraint conflicts or infeasibility
3. Check solution status - if infeasible, review constraint modifications
4. Review test output for specific error messages and assertions
5. Compare with previous successful runs to identify regression

This test serves as a **regression gate** to ensure optimization changes don't break existing functionality or degrade performance.

### Documentation Maintenance (REQUIRED)

**All changes to the optimization model MUST be synchronized with the comprehensive technical documentation.**

**Primary documentation file:**
- **Location:** `docs/UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md`
- **Content:** Complete technical specification of the UnifiedNodeModel including:
  - All decision variables with descriptions and bounds
  - All constraints with mathematical formulations
  - Objective function breakdown and cost components
  - Design patterns and implementation details
  - Performance characteristics and solver recommendations

**When to update documentation:**
- After adding, removing, or modifying decision variables
- After changing constraint formulations or logic
- After modifying the objective function
- After implementing performance optimizations
- After fixing bugs that change model behavior
- When updating variable bounds or constraint parameters
- When adding new features (pallet costs, labor models, etc.)

**How to update documentation:**
1. Open `docs/UNIFIED_NODE_MODEL_SPECIFICATION.md`
2. Update the relevant sections to match code changes
3. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp in the header
4. Add entry to the "Change Log" section at the bottom
5. Ensure all mathematical formulations remain accurate
6. Verify code references (`src/optimization/unified_node_model.py`) are correct

**Why this matters:**
- Comprehensive documentation enables understanding complex model behavior
- Keeps technical specification synchronized with implementation
- Helps onboard new developers and collaborators
- Provides authoritative reference for debugging and enhancement
- Documents design decisions and tradeoffs for future reference

**The documentation file serves as the single source of truth for model behavior** - keep it accurate and up-to-date.

## Cost Components

The objective function minimizes **total cost to serve**, comprising:

1. **Labor Costs (Piecewise Model - 2025-10-17):**
   - **Fixed days (Mon-Fri):**
     - Fixed hours (0-12h): `fixed_hours_used × regular_rate` (e.g., $20/h)
     - Overtime hours (12-14h): `overtime_hours_used × overtime_rate` (e.g., $30/h)
     - Piecewise enforcement: All fixed hours used before overtime charged
   - **Non-fixed days (weekends/holidays):**
     - All hours: `labor_hours_paid × non_fixed_rate` (e.g., $40/h)
     - 4-hour minimum payment: `labor_hours_paid ≥ max(labor_hours_used, 4.0)`
   - **Overhead time inclusion:** Labor hours include startup (0.5h) + shutdown (0.5h) + changeover time
   - **Implementation:** 5 decision variables + 8 constraint types per manufacturing node-date
   - **Performance:** Zero impact (32-38s for 4-week horizon, same as before)
   - **Bugs fixed:** (1) Overhead excluded from cost, (2) Blended rate approximation, (3) No 4h minimum enforcement

2. **Production Costs:**
   - **Source:** CostParameters sheet → `production_cost_per_unit`
   - Direct production costs per unit
   - Setup costs tracked but not currently costed (Phase 4 feature)

3. **Transport Costs:**
   - **Source:** Routes sheet → `cost` column (per-route cost per unit)
   - Cost varies by route (frozen routes typically more expensive than ambient)
   - No fixed truck costs in current implementation
   - **Truck Capacity (Unit-Based for Tractability):**
     - Capacity enforced at unit level (14,080 units = 44 pallets per truck)
     - Uses continuous truck_load variables (not integer pallets)
     - Allows fractional pallet loading (e.g., 14,050 units = 43.9 pallets OK)
     - **Note:** Pallet-level truck loading deferred to Phase 4 (performance limitations)
     - **Alternative:** Commercial solvers (Gurobi/CPLEX) may handle pallet-level truck constraints

4. **Storage/Holding Costs (Configurable: Pallet-Based or Unit-Based):**
   - **Pallet definition:** 320 units = 32 cases = 1 pallet
   - **Partial pallet rounding:** Partial pallets cost as full pallets (50 units = 1 pallet cost, not 0.156 pallets)
   - **State-specific fixed costs (NEW 2025-10-18):**
     - `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_frozen`: Fixed cost when pallet enters frozen storage
     - `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_ambient`: Fixed cost when pallet enters ambient storage
     - Override legacy `storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet` for better control
   - **Conditional pallet tracking (NEW 2025-10-18):** States with zero pallet costs use unit tracking (continuous vars), states with non-zero pallet costs use pallet tracking (integer vars)
     - **Performance benefit:** Only create integer variables for states that need them
     - **Example:** Frozen pallet costs = 0 → frozen uses units (~9k fewer integer vars for 4-week horizon)
   - **Daily frozen holding cost:** Cost per pallet per day in frozen storage (`storage_cost_per_pallet_day_frozen`)
   - **Daily ambient holding cost:** Cost per pallet per day in ambient storage (`storage_cost_per_pallet_day_ambient`)
   - **Ceiling constraint:** Implemented using auxiliary integer variables: `pallet_count * 320 >= inventory_qty`
   - **Cost minimization:** Solver automatically drives pallet_count to minimum (ceiling rounding)
   - **Legacy unit-based costs:** Still supported via `storage_cost_frozen_per_unit_day` and `storage_cost_ambient_per_unit_day`
   - **Precedence:** If both pallet and unit costs set, pallet-based takes precedence
   - **Incentive:** Minimizes inventory holding and optimizes inventory positioning across network
   - **Performance impact:** Adds ~18,675 integer variables for 4-week horizon (both states), or ~6,225 (one state), increasing solve time from ~20-30s to ~25-35s (one state) or ~35-45s (both states)
   - **Disable option:** Set all pallet storage costs to 0.0 to skip pallet variable creation (reverts to ~20-30s solve time)

   **Storage Cost Configuration Guidelines:**

   **For baseline testing and development (RECOMMENDED for CBC solver):**
   ```
   # Network_Config.xlsx - CostParameters sheet
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_frozen    0.0    # No fixed frozen pallet cost
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_ambient   0.0    # No fixed ambient pallet cost
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_frozen      0.0    # DISABLE pallet-based (fast)
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_ambient     0.0    # DISABLE pallet-based (fast)
   storage_cost_frozen_per_unit_day        0.1    # ENABLE unit-based (fast)
   storage_cost_ambient_per_unit_day       0.002  # ENABLE unit-based (fast)
   ```

   **For production optimization with cost accuracy (requires HiGHS/Gurobi/CPLEX or longer solve times):**
   ```
   # Network_Config.xlsx - CostParameters sheet
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_frozen    3.0    # Fixed cost for frozen pallet entry
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_ambient   1.5    # Fixed cost for ambient pallet entry
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_frozen      0.5    # ENABLE pallet-based (slower)
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_ambient     0.2    # ENABLE pallet-based (slower)
   storage_cost_frozen_per_unit_day        0.0    # DISABLE unit-based
   storage_cost_ambient_per_unit_day       0.0    # DISABLE unit-based
   ```

   **For hybrid mode (optimize performance + partial accuracy):**
   ```
   # Network_Config.xlsx - CostParameters sheet
   # Example: Track ambient with pallets (higher value), frozen with units (lower volume)
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_frozen    0.0    # No fixed frozen cost → uses units
   storage_cost_fixed_per_pallet_ambient   2.0    # Fixed ambient cost → uses pallets
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_frozen      0.0    # Frozen uses units (fast)
   storage_cost_per_pallet_day_ambient     0.2    # Ambient uses pallets (accurate)
   storage_cost_frozen_per_unit_day        0.1    # ENABLE for frozen
   storage_cost_ambient_per_unit_day       0.0    # DISABLE (using pallet cost)
   # Result: ~9,450 integer vars instead of ~18,675 → 25-35% faster solve
   ```

   **When to use pallet-based costs:**
   - Using commercial solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX) with better MIP performance
   - Using HiGHS solver (handles MIP efficiently)
   - Need accurate storage cost representation (partial pallets = full pallet cost)
   - Can tolerate longer solve times (35-45s vs 20-30s for 4-week horizon with CBC)
   - Have smaller problem sizes or longer time limits
   - Production use cases where cost accuracy > solve speed

   **When to use unit-based costs:**
   - Using open-source solvers (CBC, GLPK)
   - Need fast solve times for testing, development, or integration tests
   - Problem size is large (many locations, products, long horizons)
   - Solver timeout is a concern
   - Unit-based costs provide sufficient accuracy for decision-making

   **Note:** The default Network_Config.xlsx configuration uses unit-based costs (pallet costs set to 0.0) to ensure fast solve times with CBC solver and pass integration tests within the 120-second timeout.

5. **Shortage Penalty Costs:**
   - **Source:** CostParameters sheet → `shortage_penalty_per_unit`
   - High penalty for unmet demand (default: $10,000/unit)
   - Incentivizes meeting all demand when feasible
   - Only applied when `allow_shortages=True`

## Data Format Considerations

### Input Format Flexibility

The application parser expects a **simplified multi-sheet format** for ease of use and testing. However, real-world data often comes in different formats:

**Application Expected Format:**
- 6 sheets: Forecast, Locations, Routes, LaborCalendar, TruckSchedules, CostParameters
- Long format for forecasts (one row per location-product-date combination)
- Simple column structure with clear headers

**Real-World Format (SAP IBP):**
- Export format from SAP Integrated Business Planning system
- Wide format with dates as columns
- Embedded metadata and filters
- Requires preprocessing/transformation

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2-3):**
- Build format converter for SAP IBP exports
- Add `parse_sap_ibp()` method to ExcelParser
- Support multiple input formats with auto-detection
- Provide data validation and transformation utilities

## Future Considerations

- Database backend for historical data and results
- API layer for integration with other systems
- Real-time data feeds from manufacturing and logistics
- Machine learning for demand forecasting improvements
- Mobile-friendly interface for warehouse operations
- SAP IBP integration and automated data sync
- Format converters for other planning systems (Oracle, Kinaxis, etc.)
