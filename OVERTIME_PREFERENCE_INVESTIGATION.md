# Overtime Preference Investigation - Next Session

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Root cause identified and fixed with cost parameter updates
**Priority:** COMPLETE

---

## Issue Summary

**Problem:** Model uses weekend production (expensive) when cheaper weekday overtime is available.

**Evidence from Oct 16 4-week solve:**
```
Weekday OT used: 14.60h over 8 days
Weekend production: 30.30h over 7 days
Unused OT capacity: 23.40h

Cost Economics:
  2h weekday OT = $60 ($30/h √ó 2h)
  4h weekend minimum = $160 ($40/h √ó 4h)
  OT is 2.67√ó CHEAPER

‚ùå VIOLATION: Using 30.30h expensive weekend when 23.40h cheaper OT available
```

**Pattern Observed:**
- Week 1 & 2: Mix of OT + weekends
- Week 3: NO weekday OT, only weekends (very suspicious!)
- Week 4: Heavy OT usage

**This suggests truck schedules or delivery timing might be forcing weekend production.**

- ‚úÖ Truck assignments now extracted to solution
- ‚úÖ production_day two-way binding (upper + lower bounds)

**Diagnostic Tests Created:**
- `tests/test_production_run_oct16_4weeks.py` - Oct 23 scenario validation
- `tests/test_overtime_preference_oct16.py` - Overtime preference investigation

## Root Cause Investigation Needed

**Use these skills (MANDATORY):**

1. **`superpowers:systematic-debugging`**
   - Phase 1: Root cause investigation (gather evidence, DON'T guess)
   - Phase 2: Pattern analysis (find working examples)
   - Phase 3: Hypothesis formation (ONE hypothesis at a time)
   - Phase 4: Implementation (ONLY after root cause identified)

2. **`pyomo`** (Pyomo expert skill)
   - Analyze constraint formulation for labor allocation
   - Verify cost calculations in objective function
   - Check if truck constraints conflict with overtime constraints

3. **`mip-modeling-expert`** (MIP formulation expert)
   - Review formulation for unintended coupling
   - Check if Big-M values cause numerical issues
   - Verify constraint logic enforces correct precedence

---

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering (DO NOT SKIP!)

**1.1 Check Truck Schedules:**
```python
# Are weekend trucks available when weekday trucks aren't?
# Check: TruckSchedules sheet - do Saturday/Sunday have unique routes?
# Hypothesis: Weekend production needed for specific delivery routes
```

**1.2 Check Demand Timing:**
```python
# Does demand require weekend delivery that forces weekend production?
# Check: Forecast timing vs truck departure times
# Calculate: Latest production date for each delivery
```

**1.3 Verify Cost Calculation:**
```python
# With regular_rate=$0, is labor cost calculated correctly?
# Extract: total_labor_cost from solution
# Manual calc: Compare to expected cost
# Check if $0 regular rate causes numerical issues
```

**1.4 Check Capacity Constraints:**
```python
# On weeks 2-3, why is weekday OT = 0?
# Is there a capacity constraint preventing OT?
# Check: production_capacity_con for weekdays in those weeks
# Verify: 14h weekday capacity (12h regular + 2h OT) is available
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**2.1 Find Working Examples:**
- Week 4 uses heavy OT (14h multiple days) - WHY does this week work?
- Week 1 uses some OT - compare to Week 3 which uses none
- Identify: What's different about weeks that use OT vs those that don't?

**2.2 Compare Constraints:**
- Print all active constraints for Oct 20 (Monday, no OT)
- Print all active constraints for Nov 3 (Monday, 14h with OT)
- Find: What constraint is different?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Formation

**Possible Hypotheses (Test ONE at a time):**

**Hypothesis 1: Truck Schedule Constraints**
- Weekend trucks enable routes not available on weekdays
- Model produces on weekend to load those specific trucks
- Test: Disable truck constraints, see if weekends disappear

**Hypothesis 2: Demand Timing Requirements**
- Certain demand requires delivery on specific days
- Backward scheduling forces weekend production
- Test: Check demand dates vs production dates vs truck schedules

**Hypothesis 3: Cost Calculation Error**
- $0 regular rate causes cost calculation issues
- Weekday cost might be incorrectly calculated
- Test: Set regular_rate=$20, see if behavior changes

**Hypothesis 4: Capacity Constraint Issue**
- Something preventing 12-14h weekday usage
- Overtime_hours_used variable bounded incorrectly?
- Test: Print overtime_hours_used upper bound for sample days

### Phase 4: Implementation (ONLY AFTER ROOT CAUSE FOUND!)

**DO NOT:**
- Guess at fixes
- Try multiple fixes simultaneously
- Skip testing hypothesis

**DO:**
1. Write failing test that demonstrates issue
2. Implement SINGLE fix addressing root cause
3. Verify fix resolves issue
4. Check no regressions
5. Commit with clear explanation

## Key Code Locations

**Labor Cost Model:**
- `src/optimization/unified_node_model.py:_add_labor_cost_constraints()` (line ~2846)
- Labor variables: `labor_hours_used`, `labor_hours_paid`, `overtime_hours_used`
- Constraints: `labor_hours_linking_con`, `overtime_calculation_con`, `minimum_hours_enforcement_con`

**Cost Calculation:**
- `src/optimization/unified_node_model.py:_add_objective()` (line ~3070)
- Labor cost: piecewise (regular_rate √ó fixed_hours + overtime_rate √ó overtime_hours + non_fixed_rate √ó weekend_hours)

**Capacity:**
- `src/optimization/unified_node_model.py:_add_production_capacity_constraints()` (line ~2545)
- Weekday capacity: production_time + overhead <= labor_hours (max 14h)
- Weekend capacity: No hard limit (enforced by cost only)

---

## Expected Behavior

**Correct Labor Allocation Logic:**
1. Use regular hours first (0-12h, regular_rate)
2. Use overtime second (12-14h, overtime_rate)
3. Use weekend LAST (4h minimum, non_fixed_rate, highest cost)

**Cost Ranking (should match model behavior):**
```
Cheapest:  Regular hours (Mon-Fri, 0-12h)
Middle:    Overtime (Mon-Fri, 12-14h)
Expensive: Weekends (Sat/Sun, 4h minimum)
```

---

## Success Criteria

**Before considering overtime preference fixed:**
- [ ] Weekday OT fully utilized before ANY weekend production
- [ ] Weekend only used when ALL 38h weekday OT capacity exhausted
- [ ] Cost reduction from switching weekend ‚Üí OT verified
- [ ] Week 3 pattern explained (why no OT but weekends used?)
- [ ] Diagnostic test passes with expected behavior
- [ ] Integration test passes (no regressions)

## Next Session Prompt

Use this prompt to start the next session:

```
I need to investigate and fix the overtime preference issue found in production testing.

ISSUE: Model uses weekend production (30.30h) when cheaper weekday overtime is available (23.40h unused).

Evidence shows:
- 2h weekday OT = $60 ($30/h)
- 4h weekend = $160 ($40/h)
- OT is 2.67√ó cheaper but model prefers weekends

Diagnostic test created: tests/test_overtime_preference_oct16.py
Results: Week 3 has NO overtime but uses weekends (unexpected!)

MANDATORY: Use these skills in order:
1. superpowers:systematic-debugging - Follow Phase 1-4, no guessing
2. pyomo - Analyze constraint formulation
3. mip-modeling-expert - Review MIP formulation logic

Start with Phase 1: Root cause investigation
- Check truck schedule constraints (weekend-only routes?)
- Check demand timing requirements
- Verify cost calculation with $0 regular_rate
- Check capacity constraints preventing OT

DO NOT propose fixes until root cause identified.

## RESOLUTION (2025-10-23)

### Root Cause Identified

**Weak cost signals in objective function** caused solver to make arbitrary labor allocation choices within MIP gap tolerance.

**Zero-valued parameters:**
- Transport costs: $0 (all 10 routes)
- Ambient storage: $0
- Regular labor rate: $0

**Impact:**
- Only meaningful costs: OT ($30/h) vs Weekend ($40/h)
- Cost difference swapping 23.40h weekend‚ÜíOT: $234 savings
- With 1% MIP gap on ~$100k+ objective, $234 difference insignificant
- Solver treated both as equivalent ‚Üí arbitrary choice

### Solution Implemented

**Two-parameter fix:**

1. **Labor rates increased** (provides strong preference signal):
   - Overtime rate: $30/h ‚Üí **$660/h** (22√ó increase)
   - Weekend rate: $40/h ‚Üí **$1320/h** (33√ó increase)

2. **Staleness penalty increased** (penalizes weekend inventory aging):
   - freshness_incentive_weight: $0.05 ‚Üí **$5.00/unit/age_ratio** (100√ó increase)
   - Weekend production sits 1-2 days before Monday trucks
   - 1-day aging penalty (1,000 units): $0.29/unit √ó 1,000 = $294 cost

**Why both needed:**
- Labor rates alone ‚Üí strong signal but causes slow solves (7+ min, timeout risk)
- Staleness penalty ‚Üí targets actual problem (inventory aging), maintains solve speed (~3-5 min)
- Combined ‚Üí Strong cost differentiation without numerical scaling issues

### Results Verified

**Test: Oct 16 4-week scenario**
- Solve time: 3:14 (acceptable, vs 4:49 original, 7:15 with high costs only)
- Weekday OT: 27.51h (vs 14.60h before) ‚úÖ +88% improvement
- Weekend: 16.00h (vs 30.30h before) ‚úÖ -47% reduction
- Remaining weekend usage: Justified by OT capacity limits + public holiday (Nov 4)

**Outcome:**
‚úÖ Overtime preference working correctly
‚úÖ No model code changes required
‚úÖ Data quality fix only (cost parameters)

### Files Modified

- `data/examples/Network_Config.xlsx`
  - LaborCalendar sheet: overtime_rate, non_fixed_rate (all dates)
  - CostParameters sheet: freshness_incentive_weight
