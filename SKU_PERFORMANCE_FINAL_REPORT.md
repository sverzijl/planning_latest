# SKU Performance Investigation - Final Report

## Executive Summary

Investigated performance degradation when allowing binary SKU selection vs forcing all SKUs to produce. Tested multiple optimization strategies and warmstart approaches.

**Bottom line: Single-phase binary SKU optimization remains the best approach (83s, $597,869).**

---

## Problem Statement

Original issue: Model became very slow when varying SKU selection vs. forcing all products every day.

**Observed:**
- All SKUs forced: ~13s
- Binary SKU selection: 120s+ timeout ‚Üí improved to 83s

---

## Root Cause Analysis (Using Systematic Debugging)

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering

**Key Findings:**

1. **MIP Complexity Threshold at 50-60 Binary Variables:**
   - 0-40 binary vars: 12-15s (with good pattern)
   - 50-80 binary vars: 48-72s (exponential growth)
   - 140 binary vars: 83s (full problem)

2. **Pattern Quality Matters More Than Count:**
   - Smart pattern (greedy removal): 19 binary vars ‚Üí 13.5s
   - Arbitrary pattern: 20 binary vars ‚Üí 57.5s (4√ó slower!)
   - Greedy patterns are easier for solver to handle

3. **Warmstart Provides Modest Benefit:**
   - Measured: 8% speedup (78.4s ‚Üí 72.0s)
   - Requires working solution extraction

### Phase 2-3: Hypothesis Testing

**Tested Approaches:**

1. **Tighter Big-M Constraint** ‚úÖ
   - Reduced from 33,600 to 19,600 (41.7% tighter)
   - Applied automatically
   - Improves LP relaxation

2. **force_all_skus_daily Parameter** ‚úÖ
   - Solves in 13s (10√ó faster)
   - Perfect for testing/baseline
   - Cost: $774,440 (no SKU optimization)

3. **Two-Phase Solve** ‚ùå
   - Phase 1 (fixed): 13s
   - Phase 2 (binary): 157s
   - Total: 170s vs 83s single-phase
   - **Verdict: Slower than single-phase**

4. **Greedy SKU Reduction (Forcing)** ‚ùå
   - 6 phases of progressive SKU forcing
   - Total: 328s
   - **Verdict: Much slower than single-phase**

5. **Greedy Big-M Relaxation (NEW)** ‚ùå
   - Progressive Big-M tightening + warmstart
   - 3 phases + final: 262s total
   - Cost: $598,506 (similar to single-phase)
   - **Verdict: 3√ó slower than single-phase**

## What We Learned

### Why Multi-Phase Approaches Don't Help

**Problem:** Each phase with 50+ binary variables takes 50-70s to solve

**Math:**
- Single-phase: 1 solve √ó 83s = **83s total**
- Multi-phase: 5-6 solves √ó 60s + 1 final √ó 100s = **400s total**

**Conclusion:** Unless each intermediate phase is dramatically faster (<20s), multi-phase is always slower.

### When Force_All_SKUs Actually Helps

**The only time forcing reduces solve time:**
- ALL binary variables become fixed (0 binary vars)
- Solve time: 13s
- But cost increases 29% ($774k vs $598k)

**Partial forcing doesn't help because:**
- Still have 50+ binary vars ‚Üí still slow (50-80s)
- Adding warmstart saves only 8%
- Overhead of multiple solves dominates

### Why Warmstart Has Limited Impact

**Measured:**
- Cold start: 78.4s
- With warmstart: 72.0s
- **Speedup: 1.09√ó (only 8%)**

**Reason:** APPSI HiGHS has aggressive presolve that often finds good incumbent quickly. Warmstart provides diminishing returns.

## Recommendations

### For Development & Testing
**Use:** `force_all_skus_daily=True`
```python
model = UnifiedNodeModel(..., force_all_skus_daily=True)
result = model.solve(solver_name='appsi_highs')
# Solves in 13s, all SKUs produced
```

### For Production Optimization
**Use:** Single-phase binary SKU optimization
```python
model = UnifiedNodeModel(..., force_all_skus_daily=False)
result = model.solve(
    solver_name='appsi_highs',
    time_limit_seconds=180,
    mip_gap=0.03,
)
# Solves in 83s, optimal SKU selection, best cost
```

### Multi-Phase Approaches
**Not recommended** - All tested strategies are 2-4√ó slower than single-phase due to:
- Multiple full MIP solves required
- Each phase takes similar time (50-80s with 50+ binary vars)
- Warmstart provides only 8% speedup per phase
- Total time dominated by number of solves

---

## Why Single-Phase Is Best

**Key insight:** The problem has only 140 binary variables total (5 products √ó 28 days). This is **small enough** for modern MIP solvers to handle directly.

**Multi-phase would help if:**
- Problem had 1,000+ binary variables
- Each intermediate phase could be solved in <10s
- Warmstart provided 50%+ speedup
- **None of these are true for this problem**

**APPSI HiGHS is already optimized:**
- Aggressive presolve (60-70% problem reduction)
- Symmetry detection
- Parallel solving
- Good heuristics

**Conclusion:** The single-phase solve is already near-optimal. Adding complexity doesn't help.

## Final Recommendation

**For your use case (okay with longer solve times):**

Use **single-phase binary SKU optimization with APPSI HiGHS:**
- **Time:** 83 seconds
- **Cost:** $597,869 (best)
- **Gap:** 1.48% (excellent)
- **SKU reduction:** Automatic optimization

This is simpler, faster, and achieves better cost than any multi-phase approach.

The `force_all_skus_daily` parameter is valuable for fast development/testing (13s).

The multi-phase strategies are interesting academically but don't provide practical benefit for this problem size.
