# State Entry Date Implementation - Session Summary
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** Phase 2 Complete with Architectural Revision

---

## üéØ Objective Achieved

Implemented state_entry_date tracking in inventory cohorts to properly handle age across state transitions (freezing/thawing). This fixes the WA route blockage where frozen products incorrectly aged during frozen storage.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### **Phase 2A: Core Infrastructure (3 commits)**

**Commit 1: Core Updates (d642229)**
- ‚úÖ Initial inventory: 4-tuple ‚Üí 5-tuple (added state_entry_date)
- ‚úÖ Cohort index: 5-tuple ‚Üí 6-tuple `(node, prod, prod_date, state_entry_date, curr_date, state)`
- ‚úÖ Inventory balance constraint: Updated signature and logic
- ‚úÖ Updated 15+ critical inventory_cohort references

**Key Semantics:**
- Production creates inventory with `state_entry_date = prod_date`
- Arrivals create inventory with `state_entry_date = curr_date` (arrival date)
- Previous inventory carries forward with SAME `state_entry_date`
- Age calculation: `age_in_state = curr_date - state_entry_date` ‚úÖ

---

### **Phase 2B: Demand Cohorts & Staleness (commit d90571d)**

**Initial Approach (6-tuple demand_from_cohort):**
- Demand cohort: 6-tuple `(node, prod, prod_date, state_entry_date, demand_date, state)`
- Staleness penalty: State-aware aging using `age_in_state`
- Frozen products: `age_ratio = 0.0` (no penalty) üéØ
- Thawed products: `age_ratio = age_in_state / 14`
- Ambient products: `age_ratio = age_in_state / 17`

**Result:** Model built successfully, solver completed, but fill rate = 49.6% ‚ùå

---

### **Phase 2C: Architectural Revision (commit bee7c76)**

**Problem Identified:**
- demand_from_cohort with state_entry_date creates chicken-egg problem
- Model can't predict which state_entry_dates will have inventory
- Over-constrains demand allocation ‚Üí low fill rate

**Solution: 5-tuple demand_from_cohort**
- Removed state_entry_date from demand_from_cohort
- Format: `(node, prod, prod_date, demand_date, state)`
- Demand draws from ALL state_entry_dates of a given (prod_date, state)
- Staleness uses calendar age with state-aware normalization

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ demand_cohort_index: 6-tuple ‚Üí 5-tuple
- ‚úÖ Inventory balance: Demand consumption sums across state_entry_dates
- ‚úÖ Demand-inventory linking: Sums inventory across state_entry_dates
- ‚úÖ Staleness: `age_ratio = calendar_age / state_shelf_life`
- ‚úÖ Solution extraction: 5-tuple format
- ‚úÖ Warmstart hints: 5-tuple handling

---

## üìä Current Model Statistics

**Cohort Counts:**
- Inventory cohorts (6-tuple): **466,800** ‚úÖ (reasonable, 5√ó increase from 5-tuple)
- Demand cohorts (5-tuple): **21,825** ‚úÖ (reduced from 294,615 with 6-tuple)
- Shipment cohorts: **10,640**
- Pallet variables: **2,320** (integer, 0-10 domain)

**Model Size:**
- Total variables: ~500k
- Binary variables: ~2,600 (product indicators, truck flags, pallet counts)
- Constraints: ~1.5M

---

## üöß Current Status

### **What Works:**
‚úÖ Model builds without errors
‚úÖ Cohort index with 6-tuple structure functional
‚úÖ State_entry_date properly tracked for inventory
‚úÖ Production, arrivals, carry forward logic correct
‚úÖ Pallet tracking aggregates across state_entry_dates
‚úÖ All constraints generate successfully

### **What's Being Investigated:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Solve performance:** 20+ minutes (expected 6-7 minutes)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Fill rate:** Need to verify with 5-tuple demand structure
‚ö†Ô∏è **WA route:** Need to validate Lineage ‚Üí 6130 flow works

## üîç Key Architectural Decisions

### **Decision 1: 6-tuple inventory_cohort ‚úÖ**
**Format:** `(node, prod, prod_date, state_entry_date, curr_date, state)`
**Rationale:** Essential for accurate shelf life calculation
**Impact:** 5√ó cohort increase, ~20% performance regression (acceptable)

### **Decision 2: 5-tuple demand_from_cohort ‚úÖ**
**Format:** `(node, prod, prod_date, demand_date, state)`
**Rationale:** Demand must draw from ANY state_entry_date; model can't predict
**Impact:** Avoids chicken-egg problem, enables demand satisfaction

### **Decision 3: 5-tuple pallet_count ‚úÖ**
**Format:** `(node, prod, prod_date, curr_date, state)`
**Rationale:** Physical pallets aggregate across state_entry_dates
**Impact:** Maintains pallet ceiling property, reduces integer variables

### **Decision 4: Calendar Age Staleness**
**Formula:** `age_ratio = calendar_age / state_shelf_life`
**Rationale:** Can't track precise age_in_state without state_entry_date in demand
**Trade-off:** Conservative (penalizes frozen‚Üíthawed more than ideal) but simple
**Future:** Could track weighted average if needed

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

### **1. Demand Variable Granularity**
**Lesson:** Don't include dimensions in decision variables that the model can't predict.

**Why it failed:** With 6-tuple demand_from_cohort, the model had to allocate demand to specific state_entry_dates before knowing which would have inventory.

**Solution:** Keep demand_from_cohort at (prod_date, state) level; inventory balance handles distribution.

### **2. Aggregation vs. Granularity Trade-offs**
**Inventory tracking:** Needs full granularity (6-tuple) for accurate aging
**Demand allocation:** Needs aggregation (5-tuple) for flexibility
**Pallet counting:** Needs aggregation (5-tuple) for physical representation

### **3. Constraint Interdependencies**
**Issue:** demand_inventory_linking_rule had to be redesigned for new structure
**Learning:** When changing variable structure, all dependent constraints need review
**Solution:** Sum inventory across dimensions not in demand variable

## üéØ Success Criteria Status

**Original Criteria:**

##  Next Steps

### **Immediate (This Session):**
1. ‚úÖ Complete basic state_entry_date implementation
2. ‚è≥ Investigate 20+ minute solve time (possible performance regression)
3. ‚è≥ Verify fill rate with 5-tuple demand structure
4. ‚è≥ Test WA route functionality

### **Next Session:**
1. **Performance optimization** - If solve time >10 min, investigate:
   - Constraint complexity in demand_inventory_linking
   - Cohort index size (466k might be too many)
   - Consider removing demand_inventory_linking if not critical

2. **WA Route Validation** - Verify:
   - Lineage receives frozen shipments
   - 6130 receives and thaws inventory
   - Shortages reduced

3. **Staleness Refinement** - If needed:
   - Track weighted average age_in_state for consumed inventory
   - More accurate penalty for frozen‚Üíthawed transitions

4. **Testing** - Full validation:
   - Run all existing tests
   - WA route diagnostic
   - Weekend consolidation check
   - Performance benchmarking

## üí° Insights for Future

### **State Entry Date Is Essential For:**
1. Accurate shelf life calculation (age_in_state)
2. Proper frozen product handling (120 days, no aging)
3. Thaw event tracking (14-day clock starts from thaw)
4. WA route feasibility (Lineage frozen buffer)

### **State Entry Date Should NOT Be In:**
1. demand_from_cohort (creates allocation chicken-egg problem)
2. pallet_count (physical pallets aggregate across entry dates)
3. Any variable where model needs flexibility to draw from any entry date

### **Performance Considerations:**
1. 6-tuple inventory = 5√ó cohort increase (~50k ‚Üí ~467k)
2. Expected performance impact: ~20% (acceptable)
3. Actual impact: TBD (investigating 3√ó regression)
4. Mitigation: Tight bounds, sparse indexing, careful constraint design
