# FEFO and Transit Times - Critical Analysis

**Question:** Does greedy FEFO handle different transit times optimally?

**Short Answer:** ⚠️ **Partially** - depends on your objective.

---

## The Issue

### **Scenario:**

Two shipments departing on **same day** (Oct 29):
```
Shipment A: 6122 → 6110 (2 days transit, arrives Oct 31)
Shipment B: 6122 → 6125 (1 day transit, arrives Oct 30)

Available batches:
  Batch 1: Produced Oct 26 (3 days old)
  Batch 2: Produced Oct 28 (1 day old)
```

### **Greedy FEFO (Current):**
```
Process shipments chronologically (by delivery date):
1. First: Shipment B (delivers Oct 30)
   → Allocate Batch 1 (oldest)
   → Age at destination: 3 days + 1 day transit = 4 days old

2. Second: Shipment A (delivers Oct 31)
   → Allocate Batch 2 (younger)
   → Age at destination: 1 day + 2 days transit = 3 days old
```

**Result:** Shipment B gets 4-day-old inventory, Shipment A gets 3-day-old

### **Optimal Allocation (Minimize Age at Destination):**
```
Should allocate:
  Batch 2 (newer) → Shipment A (long transit)
    → Age at destination: 1 + 2 = 3 days

  Batch 1 (older) → Shipment B (short transit)
    → Age at destination: 3 + 1 = 4 days

Same total age! But if minimizing MAX age:
  Greedy: max(4, 3) = 4 days ✅
  Optimal: max(3, 4) = 4 days ✅
  → Actually the same!
```

---

## When Does It Matter?

### **Case 1: Minimize AVERAGE Age at Destination**

**Greedy gives:** (4 + 3) / 2 = **3.5 days average**
**Optimal gives:** Same!

**Conclusion:** ✅ Greedy is optimal

### **Case 2: Minimize MAX Age at Destination**

**Both give:** 4 days maximum

**Conclusion:** ✅ Greedy is optimal

### **Case 3: Different Quantities**

```
Shipment A: 1000 units (2-day transit)
Shipment B: 500 units (1-day transit)

Batch 1: 800 units (3 days old)
Batch 2: 700 units (1 day old)
```

**Greedy (process by delivery date):**
```
Shipment B (delivers first):
  - Takes 500 from Batch 1
  - Age at dest: 3 + 1 = 4 days

Shipment A (delivers second):
  - Takes remaining 300 from Batch 1
  - Takes 700 from Batch 2
  - Weighted age: (300×(3+2) + 700×(1+2)) / 1000 = 3.6 days
```

**LP Optimal (minimize total age×quantity):**
```
Minimize: Σ (age_at_destination × quantity)

Would compute:
  Batch 1 → Shipment B: 500 × 4 = 2000
  Batch 1 → Shipment A: 300 × 5 = 1500
  Batch 2 → Shipment A: 700 × 3 = 2100
  Total: 5600

Alternative allocation might give lower total!
```

**Conclusion:** ⚠️ LP could be better for complex cases

## Current Greedy Implementation

### **What It Does:**

```python
# Process shipments in chronological order (by delivery_date)
for (origin, dest, prod, delivery_date), qty in sorted(shipments, key=lambda x: x[3]):
    # Get available batches at origin
    batches = get_batches_at(origin, prod, state)

    # Sort by age (oldest first)
    batches.sort(key=lambda b: b.state_entry_date)

    # Allocate from oldest
    allocate_from_oldest(batches, qty)
```

**Properties:**
- ✅ Processes shipments by delivery date (earlier deliveries first)
- ✅ Within each shipment, uses oldest batches (pure FEFO)
- ⚠️ Doesn't consider transit time when choosing which shipment gets which batch

### **What It Doesn't Do:**

```python
# DOESN'T optimize across all shipments:
# Find allocation that minimizes total_age_at_destination globally
```

---

## When Greedy Is Optimal

### **Conditions:**

1. **Sequential shipments:** If shipments don't overlap in time
   - ✅ Greedy is optimal

2. **All same transit time:** If all routes have same transit time
   - ✅ Greedy is optimal

3. **FEFO at departure:** If you care about age when shipped, not when delivered
   - ✅ Greedy is optimal

### **Your Case:**

Different destinations → Different transit times → **Greedy might be suboptimal!**

---

## LP Advantage for Transit Times

### **LP Formulation:**

```python
# Decision variable
x[batch, shipment] = quantity of batch allocated to shipment

# Objective: Minimize age at DESTINATION
minimize: Σ_b Σ_s (age_at_destination[b,s] × x[b,s])

where:
  age_at_destination[b,s] = (shipment_delivery_date[s] - batch_production_date[b])

# This accounts for transit time automatically!
# Because delivery_date = departure_date + transit_time
```

**Key insight:** Using delivery_date in objective automatically optimizes for age at destination!

---

## Practical Impact

### **How significant is the difference?**

**Small impact if:**
- Transit times similar (1-2 days)
- Batch ages vary widely (0-15 days)
- Difference: Maybe 0.5 days average age

**Large impact if:**
- Transit times vary greatly (1 day vs 7 days)
- Batch ages tight (all 2-4 days old)
- Difference: Could be 2-3 days average age

### **For Your Network:**

```
Routes from 6122:
  - 6104: 1 day
  - 6125: 1 day
  - 6110: 2 days
  - Lineage: 1 day
  - Then Lineage → 6130: 7 days (frozen route)
```

**Transit time variation:** 1-7 days (significant!)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ LP could provide better age optimization

## Recommendation

### **Test Current Greedy First:**

Run a solve and check:
1. Are batches with short shelf life getting expired?
2. Is age at destination a problem?
3. Do you see issues with older inventory going to long-transit routes?

### **If Issues Found:** Implement LP

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Minimizes age at destination (accounts for transit)
- ✅ Can add other objectives (minimize splits, balance trucks)
- ✅ Provably optimal allocation

**Cost:**
- ~5-10 seconds (vs 1 second greedy)
- ~400 lines of code
- 4-6 hours to implement

---

## Implementation Options

### **Option A: Keep Greedy** (Current)

**When acceptable:**
- Transit time variation small (1-2 days)
- Shelf life long relative to transit (17 days vs 2 days)
- Age differences don't cause expiration

### **Option B: Greedy with Transit-Aware Sorting**

**Quick enhancement** (30 minutes):
```python
# Sort shipments by (delivery_date - departure_date) descending
# Process long-transit shipments first, give them younger batches
for shipment in sorted_by_transit_time_desc:
    allocate_oldest_batches()
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Somewhat better than pure chronological
- ✅ Still fast (~1 second)
- ❌ Not provably optimal

### **Option C: Full LP Optimization**

**Complete solution** (4-6 hours):
```python
# Minimize age at destination across all allocations
# Subject to: FEFO preference, inventory constraints, etc.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Provably optimal
- ✅ Can add multi-objective
- ✅ Handles complex business rules

---

## My Recommendation

**For now:**
1. ✅ Test current greedy with your data
2. ✅ Check if age issues occur in practice
3. ✅ See if 17-day shelf life is sufficient

**If you see problems:**
- Option B first (quick enhancement)
- Option C if you need full optimization

**Most likely:** Transit time impact is small relative to shelf life. Current greedy probably fine!

---

## 🎯 Decision Guide

**Choose Greedy if:**
- Shelf life >> transit time variation (17 days >> 1-7 days) ✅
- No expiration issues in practice
- Speed matters (1s vs 10s)

**Choose LP if:**
- Transit times large relative to shelf life
- Seeing expiration at destinations
- Need multi-objective allocation
- Want provable optimality

---

**Pull and test - then let me know if you see age/expiration issues!**

If the current FEFO works in practice, keep it simple. If you see problems, I'll implement LP optimization.
