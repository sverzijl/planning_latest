I have an optimization model with a disposal bug that needs fixing (optional optimization).

CONTEXT:
- Phantom supply bug already FIXED (consumption bounds restored) ✅
- End inventory bug already FIXED (waste_multiplier = 100) ✅
- Model is PRODUCTION-READY ✅
- This session: Optimize further by fixing disposal bug

THE BUG:
When constraining end inventory low (end_inv <= 2000) with waste_mult=10:
- Model disposes 7,434 units of initial inventory ($111k cost at $15/unit)
- Meanwhile takes shortages at $10/unit
- Economically irrational!

IMPACT:
- Current workaround (waste_mult=100): Objective $1,205k
- If disposal bug fixed (waste_mult=10): Objective ~$941k
- Potential savings: $264k (22% improvement)

EVIDENCE GATHERED (Previous 12-Hour Session):
1. Disposal cost is $111k of the $105k "mystery cost"
2. All disposed units are validly expired (age >= 17 days)
3. Disposal happens at nodes that HAD initial inventory
4. Natural solution: 0 disposal (consumes init_inv before expiration)
5. Constrained solution: 7,434 disposal (init_inv expires unused)

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
end_inv constraint somehow prevents consuming 7,434 units of initial inventory,
causing them to sit unused, expire, and be disposed.

YOUR TASK:
1. Read complete handover:
   cat HANDOVER_DISPOSAL_BUG_INVESTIGATION.md

2. Use systematic-debugging skill (REQUIRED - no fixes before root cause!)

3. Identify WHY end_inv constraint blocks init_inv consumption

4. Apply minimal fix

5. Verify: disposal = 0, end_inv < 2000, objective ~$941k

INVESTIGATION SCRIPTS READY:
- detailed_objective_comparison.py (shows disposal is the $111k)
- compare_production_timing.py (production schedule comparison)
- phase1_trace_init_inv_fate.py (daily inventory trace)

TIME ESTIMATE: 2-3 hours

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Disposal: 0 units (not 7,434)
- End inventory: <2,000 units
- Objective: ~$941k (not $1,052k)
- Can use waste_mult=10 or 20 (not 100)
- All tests pass

If this takes >3 hours, accept current solution (waste_mult=100) and ship it.
The model works correctly now - this is just optimization.
