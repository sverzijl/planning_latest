/home/sverzijl/planning_latest/src/optimization/unified_node_model.py:303: UserWarning: Zero cost parameters detected: All route transport costs are 0, ambient storage costs are 0. This may cause solver to leave some variables uninitialized (valid behavior). Consider using small non-zero costs (e.g., 0.0001) if you encounter solution extraction issues.
