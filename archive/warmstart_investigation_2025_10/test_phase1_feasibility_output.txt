‚ö†Ô∏è  Phase 1 solution is INFEASIBLE for Phase 2!
   This explains why Phase 2 can't use it

VERDICT
================================================================================

‚úÖ Phase 1 solution IS FEASIBLE for Phase 2 constraints

Conclusion:
  - Phase 1 solution satisfies ALL Phase 2 constraints
  - Phase 2 should AT MINIMUM return this solution
  - But Phase 2 started with $3.38M (not $795K)

üîç ROOT CAUSE: APPSI is NOT preserving the MIP solution
   when constraints are deactivated/reactivated!

This is either:
  A. APPSI bug/limitation (doesn't preserve MIP incumbent on model changes)
  B. We need explicit solution preservation code
