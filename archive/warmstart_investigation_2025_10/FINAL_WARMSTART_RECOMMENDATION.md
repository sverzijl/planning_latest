# Final Warmstart Investigation - Comprehensive Results

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

**Two Major Discoveries:**

1. ✅ **Start tracking formulation WORKS** - Enables APPSI warmstart
2. ✅ **Pattern warmstart is UNNECESSARY** - Pattern = Optimal already!

**Recommendation:** **Use flexible model with start tracking, solve directly (no warmstart needed)**

---

## Answers to Key Questions

### 1. Does Phase 1 Pattern Produce 5 SKUs Every Day?

**NO** - Variable SKU count:
```
Products per day distribution:
  0 SKUs: 2 days (7.1%)    ← Weekends/holidays
  5 SKUs: 26 days (92.9%)  ← All weekdays

Weekly pattern:
  Monday-Friday: All 5 SKUs every weekday
```

**Pattern forces:** Same products every weekday (not necessarily all 5)
**Optimal happens to be:** All 5 SKUs on weekdays

### 2. Are Pattern and Flexible Solutions Identical?

**YES - 100% IDENTICAL!**

```
Identical days: 28/28 (100.0%)
Different days: 0/28 (0.0%)

Pattern cost:   $763,706 in 9.8s
Flexible cost:  $763,828 in 9.3s
Difference:     $122 (0.016%)
```

**Both produce the exact same production schedule!**

### 3. Do We Need Warmstart?

**NO - Pattern warmstart is unnecessary!**

```
Warmstart approach:
  Phase 1 (Pattern): 9.8s → $763,706
  Phase 2 (Flexible): 3.3s → $763,706 (warmstart from Phase 1)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total: 13.1s → $763,706

Direct flexible solve:
  Flexible (Cold): 9.3s → $763,828
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total: 9.3s → $763,828

Difference: Cold start is 3.8s FASTER!
```

**Warmstart overhead (9.8s) > time saved (6.0s)**

### 4. Is Flexible Leveraging Increased Flexibility?

**NO - Optimal solution IS a weekly pattern!**

- Flexible model CAN choose different SKUs each day
- But optimal cost is achieved with weekly pattern
- Removing pattern constraint doesn't help

**Why:** This specific 4-week instance happens to have demand structure where weekly pattern is optimal.

## Breakthrough: Start Tracking Formulation

### The Problem with Counting Constraint

**Old formulation (BROKEN):**
```python
num_products[t] = sum(product_produced[i,t])  # Equality constraint

overhead = (S+S-C) * production_day + C * num_products
```

**Issues:**
- Strong coupling (equality ties all binaries together)
- 28 integer variables
- Requires activation/deactivation for warmstart
- APPSI sees as structural change → warmstart fails

**Performance:**
- Pattern: $779K in 8s (counting deactivated)
- Pattern: $1,957K in 124s (counting active)
- Warmstart FAILED: $779K → $1,928K (140% worse!)

### The Solution: Start Tracking (USER'S IDEA!)

**New formulation (WORKS):**
```python
product_start[i,t] ≥ product_produced[i,t] - product_produced[i,t-1]  # Inequality

overhead = (S+S-C) * production_day + C * sum(product_start[i,t])
```

**Benefits:**
- Weak coupling (inequality gives solver freedom)
- All binary variables (no integers)
- Always active (no activation/deactivation)
- APPSI sees only parameter change → warmstart works!

**Performance:**
- Pattern: $764K in 6.5s ✓
- Flexible: $764K in 6.5s ✓
- Warmstart WORKS: $764K → $764K (0% change, 3.3s Phase 2)

## Comprehensive Test Results

| Approach | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Warmstart Works? | Issue |
|----------|---------|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Counting + Deactivate** | $779K/8s | $1,928K/301s | ❌ NO | APPSI loses incumbent |
| **Counting + Always Active** | $1,957K/124s | $2,928K/121s | ❌ NO | Model too hard + incumbent lost |
| **Direct Substitution** | Buggy | $3,376K/125s | ❌ NO | Implementation error |
| **Start Tracking + Pattern** | **$764K/6.5s** | **$764K/3.3s** | **✅ YES** | **WORKS!** |
| **Start Tracking Direct** | N/A | **$764K/9.3s** | N/A | **Best overall!** |

## Final Recommendation

### For 4-Week Horizon: **Use Flexible Model with Start Tracking (No Warmstart)**

**Rationale:**
- Pattern and flexible are identical (optimal is weekly pattern)
- Cold start: 9.3s
- Warmstart: 13.1s
- **Cold start is 41% faster!**

**Implementation:**
```python
# Replace UnifiedNodeModel's counting constraint with start tracking
model = UnifiedNodeModel(..., force_all_skus_daily=False)

# Add start tracking formulation:
# - product_start[i,t] ≥ product_produced[i,t] - product_produced[i,t-1]
# - overhead = (S+S-C)*production_day + C*sum(product_start)

result = model.solve(solver_name='appsi_highs', time_limit_seconds=120)
```

### For 6+ Week Horizons: **Test if Warmstart Helps**

Since start tracking enables warmstart, test if it helps for longer horizons:

```python
# Pattern may help if flexible times out
# With start tracking, warmstart actually works!

result = solve_weekly_pattern_warmstart(
    ...,
    # Use start tracking formulation (not counting constraint)
    # Use parameter-based pattern enforcement
    # Warmstart will work!
)
```

**But first verify:** Does flexible model timeout on 6-week with start tracking?

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Replace Counting Constraint (IMMEDIATE)

**In `UnifiedNodeModel`:**

1. **Remove:**
   - `num_products_produced` integer variable (line ~XXX)
   - `num_products_counting_con` equality constraint (line ~XXX)

2. **Add:**
   - `product_start[i,t]` binary variable
   - `product_start[i,t] ≥ product_produced[i,t] - product_produced[i,t-1]` constraint

3. **Update capacity:**
   - Replace `C * num_products_produced` with `C * sum(product_start)`

**Expected benefits:**
- 2% better cost ($764K vs $779K)
- 19% faster solve (6.5s vs 8s)
- Simpler formulation
- Enables warmstart if needed later

### Phase 2: Test on 6-Week Horizon (VALIDATE)

**Verify direct solve performance:**
```python
# 6-week with start tracking
model = UnifiedNodeModel(..., end_date=start + 42 days)
result = model.solve(time_limit=300)
```

**If solves in <5 minutes:** Use direct solve (no warmstart)
**If times out:** Pattern warmstart now available (thanks to start tracking!)

   - Optimal IS a weekly pattern
   - Warmstart adds no value
   - Just solve flexible directly

4. **User's insight was critical:**
   - "Why is it a constraint?" led to discovering the problem
   - "Sequence-independent changeover" provided the solution

## Conclusion

**The warmstart investigation succeeded in finding a solution (start tracking), but also revealed the solution is unnecessary for 4-week horizons!**

**Next steps:**
1. Replace counting constraint with start tracking in `UnifiedNodeModel`
2. Test 6-week horizon to see if warmstart becomes valuable
3. Keep pattern warmstart code available (now it works!) but don't use by default

**Investigation: COMPLETE ✅**
