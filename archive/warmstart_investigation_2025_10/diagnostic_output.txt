PALLET INTEGER DIAGNOSTIC TEST
================================================================================

Objective: Isolate whether pallet integers or binary selectors cause
          the performance bottleneck in 6-week optimization

Test: Phase 1 with weekly pattern + pallet integers
      (110 binary vars + 4,515 integer vars)

================================================================================
LOADING DATA
================================================================================

Configuration:
  Horizon: 6 weeks (42 days)
  Timeout: 600s (10 minutes)
  Solver: appsi_highs
  Gap tolerance: 3%

Cost Structure Verification:
  Frozen pallet fixed: $14.26
  Frozen pallet daily: $0.9800
  ✓ Pallet costs configured - Phase 1 will create pallet variables

BUILDING PHASE 1 MODEL WITH PALLET TRACKING (DIAGNOSTIC MODE)
================================================================================

Expected variable counts:
  Binary (weekly pattern): 90 (25 pattern + 65 weekends)
  Integer (pallet tracking): ~4,515 (estimated)
  Continuous: ~100,000 (estimated)
