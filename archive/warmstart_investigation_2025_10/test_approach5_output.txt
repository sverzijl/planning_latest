APPROACH 5: Reformulated Overhead (No Counting Constraint)
================================================================================

BREAKTHROUGH: Eliminate need for constraint activation!
Strategy: Substitute sum(product_produced) directly in overhead


================================================================================
BUILD MODEL WITH REFORMULATED OVERHEAD
================================================================================

ðŸ“¦ Preprocessed initial inventory: 23 items, prod_date=2025-10-21 (one day before snapshot)

Unified Model Data Summary:
  Nodes: 11
    Manufacturing: 1
    Demand: 9
    With truck constraints: 1
  Routes: 10
  Truck schedules: 11
  Planning horizon: 2025-10-20 to 2025-11-16 (28 days)
  Products: 5
  Demand entries: 1260

Building model with reformulated overhead...

Building Unified Node Model...
  Sets defined: 11 nodes, 5 products, 28 dates, 10 routes
  Production dates for cohorts: 28 in horizon + 0 from initial inventory
  Cohort indices: 17,780 cohorts
  Shipment cohorts by origin node:
    6104: 3780
    6122: 7425
    6125: 5670
    Lineage: 1155
  Shipment cohort indices: 18,030
  Demand cohort indices: 14,175
  Changeover tracking: 28 production days, 140 product indicators (VARIABLE (binary decision))
  Labor cost variables: 28 labor hour variables added
  Variables created successfully
  Adding core constraints...
  Changeover tracking constraints added (224 constraints)
  Big-M value for product_produced linking: 19,600 units/day
  Labor cost constraints added (28 node-date pairs, 252 constraints)
  Adding storage shipment delay constraint for 3 nodes: ['6104', '6125', 'Lineage']
    Added 75 storage delay constraints
  Hybrid pallet formulation (MIP optimization):
    Small cohorts (integer 0-10): 2,030
    Domain reduced: 62 â†’ 10 (84% reduction)
  Pallet tracking enabled for states: ['frozen']
    - Pallet integer variables: 2,030
    - Domain per variable: 0-10 (vs 0-62 full formulation)
    - Unit-tracked states: ['ambient', 'thawed']
  Holding cost enabled: 17,780 total cohorts (5,926 pallet-tracked)

  Staleness penalty enabled: $0.0500 per unit per day of age
  Staleness penalty calculation: 14,175 demand cohorts
  Formula: min(age_days, 17) Ã— $0.0500 Ã— demand_satisfied
  Core constraints added
  Truck constraints added (generalized for any node)
  Model complete and ready to solve
  Added mutable parameter: pattern_active = 1.0
  Added 25 pattern variables
  Added pattern linking constraints (parameter-controlled)

  REFORMULATING overhead calculation...
  Deactivated counting constraint (not needed)
