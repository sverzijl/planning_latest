TESTING: Natural Production Spreading with Batch Tracking
======================================================================

Hypothesis: Production should spread naturally across multiple days
due to labor costs, shelf life, and transport constraints.

Test setup:
  - 4-week planning horizon (28 days)
  - Demand: 500 units/day for 26 days = 13,000 units total
  - Daily capacity: 16,800 units (regular), 19,600 (with OT)
  - Labor: Weekdays cheaper than weekends
  - Batch tracking: ENABLED
  - FIFO penalty: DISABLED (the bug fix)
  - Production smoothing: DISABLED (testing natural constraints)
