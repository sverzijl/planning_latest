**Contents:**
- Using Solvers with Pyomo

Pyomo supports modeling and scripting but does not install a solver automatically. For numerous reasons (including stability and managing intermittent dependency conflicts), Pyomo does not bundle solvers or have strict dependencies on any third-party solvers. The table below lists a subset of the solvers compatible with Pyomo that can be installed using pip or conda. It includes both commercial and open-source solvers – users are responsible for understanding the license requirements for their desired solver.

conda install ‑c ibmdecisionoptimization \ cplex

pip install cplex \ docplex

conda install ‑c ibmdecisionoptimization \ cplex docplex

conda install ‑c conda‑forge cyipopt

conda install ‑c conda‑forge glpk

conda install ‑c gurobi gurobi

conda install ‑c conda‑forge highspy

conda install ‑c conda‑forge pymumps

conda install ‑c conda‑forge scip

conda install ‑c fico‑xpress xpress

We compiled this table of solvers to help you get started, but we encourage you to consult the official documentation of your desired solver for the most up-to-date and detailed information.
