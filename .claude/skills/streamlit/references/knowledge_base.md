## What is serializable session state? - Streamlit Docs

**URL:** https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/serializable-session-state

**Contents:**
- What is serializable session state?
- Serializable Session State
  - Still have questions?

Serialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the data‚Äôs original structure. Python‚Äôs built-in pickle module serializes Python objects to a byte stream ("pickling") and deserializes the stream into an object ("unpickling").

By default, Streamlit‚Äôs Session State allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the object‚Äôs pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even lambdas returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.

To that end, Streamlit provides a runner.enforceSerializableSessionState configuration option that, when set to true, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:

By "pickle-serializable", we mean calling pickle.dumps(obj) should not raise a PicklingError exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,

**Contents:**
- Where does st.file_uploader store uploaded files and when do they get deleted?
  - Still have questions?

When you upload a file using st.file_uploader, the data are copied to the Streamlit backend via the browser, and contained in a BytesIO buffer in Python memory (i.e. RAM, not disk). The data will persist in RAM until the Streamlit app re-runs from top-to-bottom, which is on each widget interaction. If you need to save the data that was uploaded between runs, then you can cache it so that Streamlit persists it across re-runs.

As files are stored in memory, they get deleted immediately as soon as they‚Äôre not needed anymore.

This means Streamlit removes a file from memory when:

## Widget updating for every second input when using session state - Streamlit Docs

**Contents:**
- Widget updating for every second input when using session state
- Overview
- Solution
- Relevant resources
  - Still have questions?

You are using session state to store page interactions in your app. When users interact with a widget in your app (e.g., click a button), you expect your app to update its widget states and reflect the new values. However, you notice that it doesn't. Instead, users have to interact with the widget twice (e.g., click a button twice) for the app to show the correct values. What do you do now? ü§î Let's walk through the solution in the section below.

When using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, not the variable that you assigned your widget to. In the example code block below, the unique key assigned to the slider widget is slider, and the variable the widget is assigned to is slide_val.

Let's see this in an example. Say you want a user to click a button that resets a slider.

To have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a callback function with the on_click parameter of st.button:

  - Still have questions?

Are you trying to deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud, but don't know how to specify a Python dependency in your requirements file that is available on a public GitHub repo but not any package index like PyPI or Conda? If so, continue reading to find out how!

Let's suppose you want to install SomePackage and its Python dependencies from GitHub, a hosting service for the popular version control system (VCS) Git. And suppose SomePackage is found at the the following URL: https://github.com/SomePackage.git.

pip (via requirements.txt) supports installing from GitHub. This support requires a working executable to be available (for Git). It is used through a URL prefix: git+.

To install SomePackage, innclude the following in your requirements.txt file:

You can even specify a "git ref" such as branch name, a commit hash or a tag name, as shown in the examples below.

Install SomePackage by specifying a branch name such as main, master, develop, etc, in requirements.txt:

Install SomePackage by specifying a commit hash in requirements.txt:

Install SomePackage by specifying a tag in requirements.txt:

It is currently not possible to install private packages from private GitHub repos using the URI form:

where version is a tag, a branch, or a commit. And token is a personal access token with read only permissions. Streamlit Community Cloud only supports installing public packages from public GitHub repos.

## Why does Streamlit restrict nested st.columns? - Streamlit Docs

**URL:** https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/why-streamlit-restrict-nested-columns

**Contents:**
- Why does Streamlit restrict nested st.columns?
  - Still have questions?

Starting in version 1.46.0, Streamlit removed explicit limits on nesting columns, expanders, popovers, and chat message containers. To follow best design practices and maintain a good appearance on all screen sizes, don't overuse nested layouts.

From version 1.18.0 to 1.45.0, Streamlit allows nesting st.columns inside other st.columns with the following restrictions:

These restrictions were in place to make Streamlit apps look good on all device sizes. Nesting columns multiple times often leads to a bad UI. You might be able to make it look good on one screen size but as soon as a user on a different screen views the app, they will have a bad experience. Some columns will be tiny, others will be way too long, and complex layouts will look out of place. Streamlit tries its best to automatically resize elements to look good across devices, without any help from the developer. But for complex layouts with multiple levels of nesting, this is not possible.

## Sanity checks - Streamlit Docs

**URL:** https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/sanity-checks

**Contents:**
- Sanity checks
- Check #0: Are you using a Streamlit-supported version of Python?
- Check #1: Is Streamlit running?
- Check #2: Is this an already-fixed Streamlit bug?
- Check #3: Are you running the correct Streamlit binary?
- Check #4: Is your browser caching your app too aggressively?
- Check #5: Is this a Streamlit regression?
- Check #6 [Windows]: Is Python added to your PATH?
- Check #7 [Windows]: Do you need Build Tools for Visual Studio installed?
  - Still have questions?

If you're having problems running your Streamlit app, here are a few things to try out.

Streamlit will maintain backwards-compatibility with earlier Python versions as practical, guaranteeing compatibility with at least the last three minor versions of Python 3.

As new versions of Python are released, we will try to be compatible with the new version as soon as possible, though frequently we are at the mercy of other Python packages to support these new versions as well.

Streamlit currently supports versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 of Python.

On a Mac or Linux machine, type this on the terminal:

If you don't see streamlit run in the output (or streamlit hello, if that's the command you ran) then the Streamlit server is not running. So re-run your command and see if the bug goes away.

We try to fix bugs quickly, so many times a problem will go away when you upgrade Streamlit. So the first thing to try when having an issue is upgrading to the latest version of Streamlit:

...and then verify that the version number printed corresponds to the version number displayed on PyPI.

Try reproducing the issue now. If not fixed, keep reading on.

Let's check whether your Python environment is set up correctly. Edit the Streamlit script where you're experiencing your issue, comment everything out, and add these lines instead:

...then call streamlit run on your script and make sure it says the same version as above. If not the same version, check out these instructions for some sure-fire ways to set up your environment.

There are two easy ways to check this:

Load your app in a browser then press Ctrl-Shift-R or ‚åò-Shift-R to do a hard refresh (Chrome/Firefox).

As a test, run Streamlit on another port. This way the browser starts the page with a brand new cache. For that, pass the --server.port argument to Streamlit on the command line:

If you've upgraded to the latest version of Streamlit and things aren't working, you can downgrade at any time using this command:

...where 1.0.0 is the version you'd like to downgrade to. See Release notes for a complete list of Streamlit versions.

When installed by downloading from python.org, Python is not automatically added to the Windows system PATH. Because of this, you may get error messages like the following:

To resolve this issue, add Python to the Windows system PATH.

After adding Python to your Windows PATH, you should then be able to follow the instructions in our Get Started section.
