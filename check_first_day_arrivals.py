"""Check if first-day arrivals are being handled correctly.

HYPOTHESIS: With in_transit[departure_date], we can't capture goods
that departed BEFORE planning horizon but arrive AFTER planning starts.

Example:
- Planning starts: Oct 31
- Route has transit_days = 2
- Goods shipped Oct 29 → arrive Oct 31
- But in_transit[Oct 29, ...] doesn't exist (Oct 29 not in model.dates)
- So arrivals on Oct 31 = 0 (WRONG!)

The refactoring changed from:
  shipment[delivery_date] - can represent arrivals from pre-horizon shipments

To:
  in_transit[departure_date] - only includes departures within model.dates

PROBLEM:
  Goods in-transit from BEFORE planning starts can't be represented!

IMPACT:
  First-day arrivals = 0 (incorrect)
  Material balance on first day becomes infeasible
  (Can't meet demand with zero arrivals + zero/low initial inventory)

FIX NEEDED:
  Need to handle pre-horizon in-transit inventory separately
  Option 1: Add initial_in_transit parameter to model
  Option 2: Adjust initial_inventory on first day to include arriving goods
  Option 3: Create in_transit variables for pre-horizon departures (limited set)
