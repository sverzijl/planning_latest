"""Production scheduler for optimizing production timing and quantities.

Phase 2 Implementation:
This module will handle:
- Production feasibility checking against labor availability
- Production quantity determination based on demand forecast
- Production timing decisions (D-1 vs D0 for afternoon truck)
- Capacity constraint validation
- Production batch creation and assignment to trucks

Key Classes:
- ProductionScheduler: Main scheduler coordinating production decisions
- ProductionPlan: Output representing daily production quantities and timing
