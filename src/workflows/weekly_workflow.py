"""Weekly workflow for rolling horizon replanning.

The Weekly workflow is used for:
- Weekly replanning with updated forecast
- Rolling the planning horizon forward one week
- Using warmstart from previous solve for faster optimization

Characteristics:
- Full planning horizon (typically 12 weeks) completely free to optimize
- Uses warmstart from previous solve (Initial or Weekly)
- Warmstart is time-shifted forward by 1 week (weeks 2-12 become weeks 1-11)
- New week 12 is added to horizon
- Includes warmstart preview/approval workflow
- Detects large forecast changes and alerts planner
