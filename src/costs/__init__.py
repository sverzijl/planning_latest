"""Cost calculation module.

This module provides comprehensive cost calculation for production-distribution planning:
- Labor costs (fixed hours, overtime, non-fixed labor days)
- Production costs (per unit production costs)
- Transport costs (per leg, cumulative across routes)
- Waste costs (expired or discarded inventory)
- Total cost aggregation

Key components:
- CostBreakdown: Data models for cost components
- LaborCostCalculator: Calculate labor costs from production schedule and calendar
- TransportCostCalculator: Calculate transport costs from shipments and routes
- ProductionCostCalculator: Calculate production costs from batches
- WasteCostCalculator: Calculate waste/spoilage costs
- CostCalculator: Aggregate all cost components
