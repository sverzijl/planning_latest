"""Waste cost calculator.

Calculates waste costs from expired inventory and unmet demand, accounting for:
- Expired units (shelf life violations)
- Unmet demand (opportunity cost)
- Production and transport costs sunk into wasted product

NOTE: Full waste calculation requires shelf life tracking (Phase 3).
For Phase 2, provides basic framework and unmet demand tracking.

        KNOWN LIMITATION: This method only considers shipments delivered ON the demand date,
