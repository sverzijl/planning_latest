    For Weekly workflow:
    - Previous solve covered weeks 1-12
    - New solve covers weeks 1-12 (but shifted forward by 1 week calendar time)
    - Solution from previous weeks 2-12 becomes initial values for new weeks 1-11

    Example Usage:
        ```python

        shifted_warmstart = shifter.shift(
            warmstart_data=original_warmstart,
