# Temporal Aggregation Integration Summary

## Status: Implemented ✅ but Performance Not Meeting Expectations ⚠️

### What Was Implemented

1. **Model Integration (src/optimization/integrated_model.py)**
   - Modified `_extract_data()` to extract production_dates from forecast instead of generating all dates
   - Modified `_adjust_planning_horizon()` to preserve forecast dates when extending horizon
   - When temporal aggregation is used, model now creates variables only for bucket representative dates

2. **Rolling Horizon Integration (src/optimization/rolling_horizon_solver.py)**
   - `_solve_window()` applies temporal aggregation before building model
   - Creates time buckets with variable granularity
   - Aggregates forecast to buckets
   - Passes aggregated forecast to IntegratedProductionDistributionModel

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created `test_aggregation_diagnostic.py` to verify reduction in production dates
   - Diagnostic confirms temporal aggregation is working correctly

### Verification Results

**3-Week Window Test (21 days):**
- **Daily forecast:**
  - Forecast dates: 21
  - Buffer dates: 7 (for D-1 production)
  - Total production_dates: 28

- **Aggregated forecast (Week 1 daily, rest 3-day):**
  - Bucket representative dates: 12 (7 daily + 5 three-day)
  - Buffer dates: 7 (same as daily)
  - Total production_dates: 19
  - **Reduction: 32.1%** ✅

**Variable Count Reduction:**
- Daily: ~1,260 route variables
- Aggregated: ~855 route variables
- **Reduction: ~32%**

### Expected vs. Actual Performance

**Expected (from documentation):**
- 67% reduction in binary variables
- Per-window solve time: 5-15 seconds
- 6-week problem: 10-30 seconds total

**Actual:**
- 32% reduction in production dates (and route variables)
- Per-window solve time: >2 minutes (timeout)
- 6-week problem: >5 minutes (timeout)

### Why the Discrepancy?

#### 1. Buffer Dates Dilute Aggregation Benefits

The model extends the planning horizon backward by 7 days for D-1 production:
```
start_date = forecast_start - timedelta(days=7)  # 7-day buffer
```

For a 21-day window:
- Without buffer: 21 daily → 12 aggregated = **43% reduction**
- With buffer: 28 daily → 19 aggregated = **32% reduction**

The buffer dates are necessary for D-1 production but reduce the relative benefit of temporal aggregation.

#### 2. Other Variable Dimensions Dominate

Production dates is just one dimension of the variable space:
- Route variables: `shipment[route, product, date]`
- Truck variables: `truck_load[(truck, dest), product, date]` (sparse indexed)
- Inventory variables: `inventory[dest, product, date]` (sparse indexed)

Even with 32% fewer dates, the model still has:
- 5 products
- 9 routes
- 11 truck-destination pairs (sparse)
- 9 destinations

**Total variable space is still very large.**

#### 3. Constraint Complexity

Many constraints create coupling between dates:
- Flow conservation (invent

ory continuity)
- Truck loading constraints
- Labor capacity constraints
- Production-shipment matching

These constraints create interdependencies that make the problem difficult even with fewer dates.

#### 4. Possible CBC Solver Limitations

The CBC solver may struggle with this problem structure regardless of temporal aggregation. Commercial solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX) might perform better.

### Actual Benefit of Temporal Aggregation

Despite not meeting performance targets, temporal aggregation provides:

1. **Memory Reduction:** 32% fewer variables means lower memory usage
2. **Scalability:** Enables solving longer horizons than would otherwise be possible
3. **Correct Implementation:** The infrastructure is in place and working correctly

### Alternative Solutions

Since temporal aggregation alone doesn't achieve target performance, consider:

1. **Smaller Windows**
   - Use 14-day windows instead of 21-day
   - Trade-off: More windows, more overhead, but faster per-window solve

2. **More Aggressive Aggregation**
   - Use 3-day buckets throughout (no daily period)
   - Would give ~43-50% reduction instead of 32%

3. **Commercial Solver**
   - Try Gurobi or CPLEX instead of CBC
   - These solvers have much better MIP performance

4. **Model Simplification**
   - Reduce max_routes_per_destination (currently 5)
   - Aggregate products into families
   - Pre-fix some truck assignments

5. **Heuristic Approaches**
   - Use optimization for near-term (Week 1) only
   - Use simpler rules for far-term planning
   - Iterative refinement strategy

### Recommendations

**Short-term:**
1. Try 14-day windows with temporal aggregation
2. Test with commercial solver (Gurobi) if available
3. Experiment with uniform 3-day aggregation (no variable granularity)

**Medium-term:**
1. Implement model simplifications (reduce routes, aggregate products)
2. Explore heuristic/hybrid approaches
3. Profile solver performance to identify bottlenecks

**Long-term:**
1. Consider decomposition approaches (Benders, Dantzig-Wolfe)
2. Explore column generation for route selection
3. Investigate specialized algorithms for perishable inventory problems

### Conclusion

**Temporal aggregation is implemented correctly and working as designed.** It reduces production dates by 32%, but this is not sufficient to achieve the target solve times due to:
- Buffer dates reducing relative benefit
- Other variable dimensions (products, routes, trucks) dominating complexity
- Constraint coupling creating difficult subproblems
- Possible CBC solver limitations

The rolling horizon infrastructure is complete and ready to use. However, achieving <2 minute solve times for the full 29-week dataset will likely require **additional optimization beyond temporal aggregation**, such as:
- Smaller windows (14 days)
- Commercial solver (Gurobi/CPLEX)
- Model simplifications
- Heuristic approaches

The investment in rolling horizon + temporal aggregation was valuable and positions us well for these next steps.
