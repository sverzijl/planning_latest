# UI Data Completeness Check - SlidingWindowModel

**Purpose:** Verify all Results page tabs have complete data from the model.

## ✅ Data Available from SlidingWindowModel

### **Core Solution Fields:**

```python
solution = model.get_solution()

# Production
✅ production_by_date_product: {(node, product, date): qty}
✅ total_production: float
✅ production_batches: [{node, product, date, quantity}]

# Inventory
✅ inventory: {(node, product, state, date): qty}
✅ has_aggregate_inventory: True (flag for Daily Snapshot)

# Shipments
✅ shipments_by_route_product_date: {(origin, dest, product, delivery_date): qty}
✅ truck_assignments: {(origin, dest, product, delivery_date): truck_idx}

# State Transitions
✅ freeze_flows: {(node, product, date): qty}
✅ thaw_flows: {(node, product, date): qty}

# Labor
✅ labor_hours_by_date: {date: hours}
✅ labor_cost_by_date: {date: cost}

# Demand
✅ shortages: {(node, product, date): qty}
✅ total_shortage_units: float
✅ fill_rate: float

# Costs
✅ total_cost: float
✅ total_labor_cost: float
✅ total_production_cost: float
✅ total_transport_cost: float
✅ total_shortage_cost: float
```

### **Model Attributes:**

```python
model = SlidingWindowModel(...)

# After extraction
✅ model.route_arrival_state: {(origin, dest): 'frozen'|'ambient'|'thawed'}
✅ model.solution: Full solution dict
```

### **Methods:**

```python
✅ model.get_solution() → Dict with all fields above
✅ model.extract_shipments() → List[Shipment] with truck assignments
✅ model.apply_fefo_allocation() → Batch detail (optional)
```

## 📊 Results Page Tab-by-Tab Analysis

### **Tab 1: Overview** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Required:**
- production_schedule.total_units
- cost_breakdown.total_cost
- result.termination_condition
- result.solve_time_seconds
- fill_rate

**Status:**
- ✅ All fields available
- ✅ Metrics display correctly
- ✅ Solver diagnostics show

### **Tab 2: Production** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Required:**
- production_schedule.production_batches
- production_schedule.daily_totals
- production_schedule.daily_labor_hours
- production_schedule.total_units

**Status:**
- ✅ All fields provided via result_adapter
- ✅ Charts display all 5 products
- ✅ Labor hours ~11h/day
- ✅ Capacity utilization shows

### **Tab 3: Labeling** ⚠️ **NEEDS FIX**

**Required:**
- model.route_arrival_state (which routes frozen vs ambient)
- solution.production_batches
- Optional: batch_shipments

**Current Status:**
- ✅ production_batches available
- ⚠️ route_arrival_state - JUST ADDED (needs testing)
- ❌ batch_shipments - not available (aggregate model)

**Fix Needed:**
- Test route_arrival_state attribute works
- Consider adding shipment states to solution

### **Tab 4: Distribution** ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

**Required:**
- shipments with assigned_truck_id
- truck_plan (TruckLoadPlan)

**Status:**
- ✅ shipments extracted
- ✅ truck assignments (72 shipments)
- ✅ truck_plan created
- ⚠️ Shipment.route might need state info

### **Tab 5: Costs** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Required:**
- cost_breakdown.total_cost
- cost_breakdown.labor
- cost_breakdown.production
- cost_breakdown.transport

**Status:**
- ✅ All cost components extracted
- ✅ Charts display correctly
- ✅ Breakdown by category works

### **Tab 6: Comparison** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status:**
- ✅ Works (compares heuristic vs optimization)
- ✅ No special requirements

### **Tab 7: Daily Snapshot** ✅ **FIXED**

**Required:**
- model_solution with inventory
- has_aggregate_inventory flag

**Status:**
- ✅ Aggregate inventory support added
- ✅ Shows all 11 locations
- ✅ Inventory by product and state

## ⚠️ Missing/Incomplete Items

### **1. Route State Information** (Labeling Tab)

**Issue:** Warning about frozen vs ambient routes

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# In extract_solution():
model.route_arrival_state = {
    (origin, dest): 'frozen'|'ambient'|'thawed'
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Added, needs testing

### **2. Shipment States** (Distribution Tab)

**Current:** Shipments created with generic 'ambient' state

**Enhancement:**
```python
# In extract_shipments():
# Determine actual state from shipment variables
for (origin, dest, prod, delivery_date, state) in model.shipment:
    if value > 0:
        # Track which state(s) this shipment uses
```

**Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have for accuracy)

### **3. FEFO Batch Integration** (Optional)

**Current:** FEFO exists but not auto-called

**Options:**

**A. Auto-Enable (adds ~1s):**
```python
# In result_adapter.py after get_solution():
if hasattr(model, 'apply_fefo_allocation'):
    fefo_detail = model.apply_fefo_allocation()
    solution['fefo_batches'] = fefo_detail['batches']
```

**B. On-Demand:**
- Keep as manual call
- Use when needed (Daily Snapshot, Labeling)

**Recommendation:** B (on-demand) to keep solves fast

## 🎯 Action Items

### **Immediate (This Commit):**
1. ✅ Add route_arrival_state to model
2. ⏳ Test labeling warning is gone
3. ⏳ Verify route states correct

### **Optional Enhancements:**
1. Extract shipment states accurately (frozen vs ambient)
2. Auto-enable FEFO for Daily Snapshot (if needed)
3. Add batch_shipments for detailed labeling
