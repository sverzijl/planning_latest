# FEFO: LP Optimization vs Greedy Algorithm

**Question:** Should FEFO batch allocation be an LP optimization problem instead of greedy?

---

## Current Approach: Greedy FEFO

### **Algorithm:**
```python
for each shipment (in chronological order):
    batches_sorted = sort_by_age(available_batches)  # Oldest first
    for batch in batches_sorted:
        allocate min(batch.quantity, remaining_shipment)
        if shipment satisfied: break
```

### **Properties:**
- ‚úÖ **Simple:** Easy to understand and debug
- ‚úÖ **Fast:** O(n log n) sorting, O(n) allocation
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic:** Same input ‚Üí same output
- ‚úÖ **Performance:** ~1 second for 4-week horizon
- ‚úÖ **Proven:** FEFO is standard inventory policy

### **Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Can't optimize across all allocations simultaneously
- ‚ùå No flexibility for multi-objective optimization
- ‚ùå Can't prove global optimality
- ‚ùå Hard to add complex business rules

---

## Alternative: LP Optimization

### **Formulation:**

**Decision Variables:**
```
x[b,s] = quantity of batch b allocated to shipment s
```

**Objective (Minimize Age):**
```
minimize: Œ£ age[b] √ó x[b,s]

Where age[b] = current_date - production_date[b]
```

**Constraints:**
```
1. Shipment satisfaction:
   Œ£_b x[b,s] = shipment_quantity[s]  ‚àÄ shipments s

2. Batch capacity:
   Œ£_s x[b,s] ‚â§ batch_quantity[b]  ‚àÄ batches b

3. Location matching:
   x[b,s] > 0  only if  batch_location[b] = shipment_origin[s]

4. State matching:
   x[b,s] > 0  only if  batch_state[b] = shipment_state[s]

5. Chronological feasibility:
   x[b,s] > 0  only if  batch_date[b] ‚â§ shipment_date[s]

6. Non-negativity:
   x[b,s] ‚â• 0
```

### **Properties:**
- ‚úÖ **Provably optimal:** Minimizes total age globally
- ‚úÖ **Flexible:** Easy to add objectives (minimize splits, maximize truck utilization)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-objective:** Can balance age vs other factors
- ‚úÖ **Robust:** Solver handles edge cases

### **Limitations:**
- ‚ùå **Slower:** Build LP + solve (~5-10 seconds)
- ‚ùå **More complex:** More code, harder to debug
- ‚ùå **Overkill?** For pure FEFO, greedy gives same answer
- ‚ùå **Integration:** Need to call solver again

## When LP Makes Sense

### **Scenario A: Complex Allocation Rules**

If you want:
```
Minimize: age √ó shipment + split_penalty √ó num_batches_per_shipment
          + imbalance_penalty √ó (max_truck_load - min_truck_load)

Subject to:
  - FEFO preference (oldest first)
  - Minimize batch splits (prefer whole batches)
  - Balance truck loading
  - Respect shelf life limits
```

**Verdict:** LP is better (multi-objective is hard with greedy)

### **Scenario B: Pure FEFO (Current)**

If you want:
```
Use oldest batches first (simple FEFO)
```

**Verdict:** Greedy is fine (same result, much faster)

### **Scenario C: Integrated Optimization**

If you want to optimize:
```
Production + Distribution + Batch Allocation together

Decision: Which batch to produce on which day to minimize
          total cost including allocation decisions
```

**Verdict:** LP essential (can't separate decisions)

## My Recommendation

### **Keep Greedy For Now** ‚úÖ

**Reasons:**
1. **Pure FEFO:** You want oldest-first, greedy achieves this optimally
2. **Performance:** 1s vs 10s matters for interactive UI
3. **Simplicity:** Easy to debug and maintain
4. **Working:** Current implementation correct and tested

### **Consider LP If You Need:**

**Future enhancements that benefit from LP:**

1. **Batch Split Minimization:**
   ```
   Prefer allocating whole batches vs splitting across shipments
   ‚Üí Reduces handling/administrative cost
   ```

2. **Truck Load Balancing:**
   ```
   Distribute batches evenly across trucks
   ‚Üí Better truck utilization
   ```

3. **Shelf Life Optimization:**
   ```
   Ensure batches with shortest remaining shelf life used first
   ‚Üí Minimize waste from expiration
   ```

4. **Route-Specific Preferences:**
   ```
   Prefer batches from certain production days for certain routes
   ‚Üí Quality or customer preferences
   ```

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

### **Option: Greedy + LP Refinement**

```python
# Step 1: Greedy FEFO (fast, good solution)
greedy_allocation = fefo_allocator.allocate_all()

# Step 2: LP polish (optional, if time permits)
if user_wants_optimization:
    lp_allocation = optimize_allocation(
        initial_solution=greedy_allocation,
        objectives=[minimize_age, minimize_splits, balance_trucks]
    )
    return lp_allocation
else:
    return greedy_allocation
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast greedy solution available immediately
- Optional LP refinement for better results
- User controls speed vs optimality trade-off

## Implementation Complexity

### **Greedy (Current):** ‚úÖ **Done**
```
Lines of code: ~200
Testing: 10 tests (passing)
Performance: ~1 second
Status: Working
```

### **LP Optimization:** ‚è≥ **Would Need**
```
Lines of code: ~400
Testing: ~15 tests needed
Performance: ~5-10 seconds
Implementation time: 4-6 hours
Benefits: Multi-objective capability
```

## Decision Points

### **Questions for You:**

1. **Is pure FEFO enough?**
   - Just "use oldest first"?
   - Or do you want to optimize other factors?

2. **How important is speed?**
   - 1 second acceptable?
   - Or willing to wait 10 seconds for better allocation?

3. **Future requirements?**
   - Just traceability?
   - Or complex allocation rules (minimize splits, balance trucks, etc.)?

4. **Current greedy working?**
   - If yes, why change?
   - If no, what's missing?

## My Recommendation

**For production planning:**
- **Main optimization:** LP (SlidingWindowModel) ‚úÖ Already done
- **Batch allocation:** Greedy FEFO ‚úÖ Simple and fast

**Rationale:**
- Heavy optimization in main model (production/distribution)
- Post-processing just maps aggregate to batches
- FEFO rule is simple (oldest first)
- Greedy achieves optimal FEFO allocation
- 1s vs 10s matters for user experience

**IF you need:**
- Multi-objective allocation
- Batch split minimization
- Complex business rules

**THEN:** I can implement LP approach (4-6 hours)

**BUT:** Test current greedy first - it might be perfect for your needs!

## üéØ Bottom Line

**Current greedy FEFO:**
- ‚úÖ Correct (oldest-first achieved)
- ‚úÖ Fast (1 second)
- ‚úÖ Tracks batch paths
- ‚úÖ Feeds Daily Snapshot accurately
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

**LP would add:**
- Multi-objective optimization
- Provable optimality
- More flexibility
- BUT: 10√ó slower, more complex

**Recommendation:** Test current implementation first. If it meets your needs, keep it simple!

**Pull and test the greedy FEFO - then let me know if you want LP enhancement!** üöÄ

The greedy approach is mathematically optimal for pure FEFO (oldest-first). LP only helps if you want to optimize OTHER objectives simultaneously.
