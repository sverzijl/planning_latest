seconds was changed from 1e+100 to 120
ratioGap was changed from 0 to 0.01
passPresolve was changed from 5 to 10
No match for feaspump - ? for list of commands
No match for on - ? for list of commands
Multiple matches for diving - possible completions:
DivingS(ome)
DivingC(oefficient)
DivingF(ractional)
DivingG(uided)
DivingL(ineSearch)
DivingP(seudoCost)
DivingV(ectorLength)
No match for on - ? for list of commands
Option for proximitySearch changed from off to on
tunePreProcess was changed from 6 to 2
Option for printingOptions changed from normal to all
Presolve determined that the problem was infeasible with tolerance of 1e-08
Presolved model looks infeasible - will use unpresolved
Original problem has 300 integers (300 of which binary)
==== 83 zero objective 17 different
==== absolute objective values 17 different
==== for integers 25 zero objective 2 different
25 variables have objective of 0
275 variables have objective of 100
==== for integers absolute objective values 2 different
25 variables have objective of 0
275 variables have objective of 100
===== end objective counts


Problem has 8531 rows, 9845 columns (9762 with objective) and 31939 elements
There are 1159 singletons with objective 25 singletons with no objective 
Column breakdown:

Success: False
Termination: infeasible
Solve Time: 6.21s

‚ùå INFEASIBLE: Model is infeasible. Constraints cannot all be satisfied simultaneously.

This indicates an error in the inventory-based truck loading implementation.
The model constraints are over-constrained or incorrectly formulated.
