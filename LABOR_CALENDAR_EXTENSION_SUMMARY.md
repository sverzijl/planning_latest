## Bug Fix Notes

**Issue Identified:** Initial version of script only included 2026 public holidays, missing the 2025 Christmas holidays (Dec 25, 26, 29) that fell within the extension period.

**Resolution:** Script was corrected to include both 2025 end-of-year holidays and all 2026 holidays. The file was restored from backup and regenerated with correct holiday markings.

**Verification:** All 2025 Christmas holidays now properly marked as non-fixed days with the weekend/holiday pattern.

- ✓ Fully documented
- ✓ Reusable for future extensions
- ✓ Includes Victoria public holiday definitions (2025 & 2026)
- ✓ Provides comprehensive validation
- ✓ Safe (creates backup before modification)
- ✓ Corrected to handle multi-year holiday definitions
